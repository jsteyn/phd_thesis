  Abstract                 = {Introduction Small networks that generate rhythmic motor patterns in invertebrates have been the subject of intense experimental and theoretical analyses aimed at articulating some of the basic principles that govern the dynamics of neural circuits (Getting, 1989). Although there are significant differences between small invertebrate networks and large vertebrate brain structures, they share a large number of organizational and functional mechanisms. Because invertebrate pattern generators contain relatively small numbers of large, easily studied neurons, they offer the potential for uncovering some of the basic computational and functional characteristics of neural circuits in the brain. Central pattern generating networks are groups of neurons that produce rhythmic motor patterns even in the absence of timing signals from sensory or central inputs (Marder and Calabrese, 1996). These circuits are involved in behaviors such as walking, swimming, flying, breathing, and chewing.},

  Abstract                 = {The pyloric network of the stomatogastric ganglion in crustacea is a central pattern generator that can produce the same basic rhythm over a wide frequency range. Three electrically coupled neurons, the anterior burster (AB) neuron and two pyloric dilator (PD) neurons, act as a pacemaker unit for the pyloric network. The functional characteristics of the pacemaker network are the result of electrical coupling between neurons with quite different intrinsic properties, each contributing a basic feature to the complete circuit. The AB neuron, a conditional oscillator, plays a dominant role in rhythm generation. In the work described here, we manipulate the frequency of the AB neuron both isolated and electrically coupled to the PD neurons. Physiological and modeling studies indicate that the PD neurons play an important role in regulating the duration of the bursts produced by the pacemaker unit.}

Here we use two-photon calcium imaging to record the activity of large populations of neurons at the cellular level, throughout the brain of larval zebrafish expressing a genetically encoded calcium sensor, while the paralysed animals interact fictively with a virtual environment and rapidly adapt their motor output to changes in visual feedback. We decompose the network dynamics involved in adaptive locomotion into four types of neuronal response properties, and provide anatomical maps of the corresponding sites. A subset of these signals occurred during behavioural adjustments and are candidates for the functional elements that drive motor learning. Lesions to the inferior olive indicate a specific functional role for olivocerebellar circuitry in adaptive locomotion. This study enables the analysis of brain-wide dynamics at single-cell resolution during behaviour.},

  Abstract                 = {Central pattern generators are networks of neurons capable of generating an output pattern of spike activity in a relatively stereotyped, rhythmic pattern that has been found to underlie vital functions like respiration and locomotion. The central pattern generator for locomotion in vertebrates seems to share some basic building blocks. Activation and excitation of activity is driven by descending, sensory, and intraspinal glutamatergic neurons. NMDA receptor activation may also lead to the activation of oscillatory properties in individual neurons that depend on an array of ion channels situated in those neurons. Coordination across joints or the midline of the animal is driven primarily by glycinergic inhibition. In addition to these processes, numerous modulatory mechanisms alter the function of the central pattern generator. These include metabotropic amino acid receptors activated by rhythmic release of glutamate and GABA as well as monoamines, ACh, and peptides. Function and stability of the central pattern generator is also critically dependent on the array of ion channels found in neurons that compose these oscillators, including Ca2+ and voltage-gated K+ channels and Ca2+ channels.},

Here, we propose a new way of describing biological neural systems in terms of abstract communication systems. Such systems use pattern languages formulated as probabilistic continuation rules that determine which communications follow other communications. We apply this framework to define neural communication systems. The formal analysis is followed by a brief interpretation of how the crab stomatogastric ganglion works in the context of the proposed framework. We also discuss further implications of the description of neural systems as abstract communication systems.},

  Abstract                 = {We carried out experiments to monitor optically the generation and spread of action potentials and subthreshold potentials in the processes of individual neurons in ganglia of the snail, Helix aspersa. The neurons were selectively stained by intracellular pressure injection of voltage-sensitive dyes. Optical signals were detected by a system for fast, multiple-site optical monitoring, utilizing a silicon photodiode array. After testing 30 voltage-sensitive dyes using absorption, we concluded that this mode was probably not sensitive enough to allow monitoring neuronal signals from distal processes. Satisfactory signals were obtained in fluorescence measurements using a newly synthesized styryl dye, JPW1114, specifically designed for intracellular application. There was an improvement in sensitivity (as defined by the signal-to-noise ratio) by a factor of about 50 over previously reported absorption and fluorescence signals from neuronal processes stained by either intra- or extracellular application of dyes. Recordings with good signal-to-noise ratio and adequate spatial and temporal resolution were obtained simultaneously from the cell body and long axonal branches. From this data, the site of action potential initiation was determined. Also, the propagation velocity of the action potential was calculated for different axonal segments; the results suggest that different regions have different velocities ranging from 0.53 m/sec to 0.07 m/sec. The present sensitivity was adequate to allow the recording of a 10 mV hyperpolarizing electrotonic response along axonal branches and to observe directly the decline of this passive response with distance from the site of stimulation. Relatively modest improvements in sensitivity will allow systematic analyses of the spread and summation of synaptic potentials in individual neurons.},

  Abstract                 = {Insect neural networks have been widely and successfully employed as model systems in the study of the neural basis of behavior. The insect frontal ganglion is a principal part of the stomatogastric nervous system and is found in most insect orders. The frontal ganglion constitutes a major source of innervation to foregut muscles and plays a key role in the control of foregut movements. Following a brief description of the anatomy and development of the system in different insect groups, this review presents the current knowledge of the way neural networks in the insect frontal ganglion generate and control behavior. The frontal ganglion is instrumental in two distinct and fundamental insect behaviors: feeding and molting. Central pattern-generating circuit(s) within the frontal ganglion generates foregut rhythmic motor patterns. The frontal ganglion networks can be modulated in-vitro by several neuromodulators to generate a variety of motor outputs. Chemical modulation as well as sensory input from the gut and input from other neural centers enable the frontal ganglion to induce foregut rhythmic patterns under different physiological conditions. Frontal ganglion neurons themselves are also an important source of neurosecretion. The neurosecretory material from the frontal ganglion can control and modulate motor patterns of muscles of the alimentary canal. The current and potential future importance of the insect stomatogastric nervous system and frontal ganglion in the study of the neural mechanisms of behavior are discussed.},

In this paper we investigate the contribution of individual network components in determining the specific amine-induced cycle frequency. We used photoinactivation of identified neurons and pharmacological blockade of synapses to isolate the anterior burster (AB) and pyloric dilator (PD) neurons. Bath application of DA, 5HT, or Oct enhanced cycle frequency in an isolated AB neuron, with DA generating the most rapid oscillations and Oct the slowest. When an AB–PD or AB–2xPD subnetworks were tested, DA often reduced the ongoing cycle frequency, whereas 5HT and Oct both evoked similar accelerations in cycle frequency. However, in the intact pyloric network, both DA and Oct either reduced or did not alter the cycle frequency, whereas 5HT continued to enhance the cycle frequency as before. Our results show that the major target of 5HT in altering the pyloric cycle frequency is the AB neuron, whereas DA’s effects on the AB–2xPD subnetwork are critical in understanding its modulation of the cycle frequency. Octopamine’s effects on cycle frequency require an understanding of its modulation of the feedback inhibition to the AB–PD group from the lateral pyloric neuron, which constrains the pacemaker group to oscillate more slowly than it would alone. We have thus demonstrated that the relative importance of the different network components in determining the final cycle frequency is not fixed but can vary under different modulatory conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {Similar activity patterns at both neuron and network levels can arise from different combinations of membrane and synaptic conductance values. A strategy by which neurons may preserve their electrical output is via cell type-dependent balances of inward and outward currents. Measurements of mRNA transcripts that encode ion channel proteins within motor neurons in the crustacean cardiac ganglion recently revealed correlations between certain channel types. To determine whether balances of intrinsic currents potentially resulting from such correlations preserve certain electrical cell outputs, we developed a nominal biophysical model of the crustacean cardiac ganglion using biological data. Predictions from the nominal model showed that coregulation of ionic currents may preserve the key characteristics of motor neuron activity. We then developed a methodology of sampling a multidimensional parameter space to select an appropriate model set for meaningful comparison with variations in correlations seen in biological datasets.},

  Abstract                 = {We studied the axons of the pyloric dilator neurons in the stomatogastric nervous system of the lobster. The several-centimeters-long portions of these axons in the motor nerves depolarize in response to low concentrations of dopamine (DA) and exhibit peripheral spike initiation in the absence of centrally generated activity. This effect is inhibited by blockers of hyperpolarization-activated inward current (I(h)). We show here that peripheral spike initiation was also elicited by D(1)-type receptor agonists and drugs that increase cAMP. This suggests that DA acts via a D(1)-type receptor mechanism to modulate hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels. We used two-electrode voltage clamp of the axon to directly study the effect of DA on I(h). Surprisingly, DA decreased the maximal conductance. However, because of a shift of the activation curve to more depolarized potentials, and a change in the slope, conductance was increased at biologically relevant membrane potentials. These changes were solely caused by modulation of I(h), as DA had no discernible effect when I(h) was blocked. In addition, they were not induced by repeated activation and could be mimicked by application of drugs that increase cAMP concentration. DA modulation of I(h) persisted in the presence of a protein kinase A inhibitor and is therefore potentially mediated by a phosphorylation-independent direct effect of cAMP on the ion channel. A computer model of the axon showed that the changes in maximal conductance and voltage dependence were not qualitatively affected by space-clamp problems.},

  Abstract                 = {In this study, we present a novel model for Huntington’s disease (HD) gait disorder. We consider the mathematical relations between blocks. The number of inputs and outputs of each block are designated due to the physiological findings. The connection types between blocks are modeled by gains. Inner structure of each block is modeled using a central pattern generator neural network. Our model is able to simulate the normal and HD strides time intervals and shows how diazepam is able to ameliorate the gait disorder; however, we believe that this treatment is somehow irrational. Using GABA blockers recovers the symptoms but it means omitting BG from motor control loop. Our model shows that increment of GABA aggravates the gait disorder. Our novel idea about BG treatment is to reduce glutamate. Experimental studies are needed for evaluating this novel treatment. This validation would implement a milestone in treatment of such a debilitating disease. It seems that synchronization of a number of neurons is the major disturbance in HD. The synchronization was modeled as CPG (Central Pattern Generator) structure. We supposed that the disorder will recover if the wrong synchronization of the neurons is diminished. Therefore, deep brain stimulation may be useful in this regard.},

Recent research on schizophrenia indicates that cognitive deficits in this illness are important predictors of functional outcome, highlighting the need for treatments that have a positive impact on cognitive function. Here we explore the hypothesis that acute administration of d-amphetamine can improve cognitive function in individuals with schizophrenia who are well-treated with typical antipsychotics, as well as in healthy controls performing under dual task conditions designed to elicit performance deficits analogous to those found in schizophrenia.
Methods

Ten individuals with schizophrenia taking haldol or prolixin and 22 healthy controls performed spatial working memory, language production, and Stroop tasks under both placebo and 0.25 mg/kg of d-amphetamine.
Results

d-Amphetamine improved reactions times on the spatial working memory and Stroop tasks for both individuals with schizophrenia and controls, and improved working memory accuracy in schizophrenia. In addition, d-amphetamine improved language production for both individuals with schizophrenia and controls.
Conclusions

These results provide support for the hypothesis that the adjunctive administration of dopamine agonist can improve cognitive in individuals with schizophrenia taking typical antipsychotics. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for understanding the nature of working memory deficits in schizophrenia, and potential future avenues for cognitive enhancement in this illness.},

Here we briefly review evidence regarding the pattern of deficits within three domains: context processing, working memory and episodic memory. We suggest that there may be a common mechanism driving deficits in these domains -- an impairment in the ability to actively represent goal information in working memory to guide behavior, a function we refer to as proactive control. We suggest that such deficits in proactive control reflect impairments in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, its interactions with other brain regions such as parietal cortex, thalamus, and striatum, and the influence of neurotransmitter systems such as dopamine, GABA and glutamate.},

  Abstract                 = {Different Shaker family alpha-subunit genes generate distinct voltage-dependent K+ currents when expressed in heterologous expression systems. Thus it generally is believed that diverse neuronal K+ current phenotypes arise, in part, from differences in Shaker family gene expression among neurons. It is difficult to evaluate the extent to which differential Shaker family gene expression contributes to endogenous K+ current diversity, because the specific Shaker family gene or genes responsible for a given K+ current are still unknown for nearly all adult neurons. In this paper we explore the role of differential Shaker family gene expression in creating transient K+ current (IA) diversity in the 14-neuron pyloric network of the spiny lobster, Panulirus interruptus. We used two-electrode voltage clamp to characterize the somatic IA in each of the six different cell types of the pyloric network. The size, voltage-dependent properties, and kinetic properties of the somatic IA vary significantly among pyloric neurons such that the somatic IA is unique in each pyloric cell type. Comparing these currents with the IAs obtained from oocytes injected with Panulirus shaker and shal cRNA (lobster Ishaker and lobster Ishal, respectively) reveals that the pyloric cell IAs more closely resemble lobster Ishal than lobster Ishaker. Using a novel, quantitative single-cell-reverse transcription-PCR method to count the number of shal transcripts in individual identified pyloric neurons, we found that the size of the somatic IA varies linearly with the number of endogenous shal transcripts. These data suggest that the shal gene contributes substantially to the peak somatic IA in all neurons of the pyloric network.},

After partial SCI, however, the role of this spinal CPG in the recovery of hindlimb locomotion in the cat remains mostly unknown. In the present work, we devised a dual-lesion paradigm to determine its possible contribution after partial SCI. After a partial section of the left thoracic segment T10 or T11, cats gradually recovered voluntary quadrupedal locomotion. Then, a complete transection was performed two to three segments more caudally (T13-L1) several weeks after the first partial lesion. Cats that received intensive treadmill training after the partial lesion expressed bilateral hindlimb locomotion within hours of the complete lesion. Untrained cats however showed asymmetrical hindlimb locomotion with the limb on the side of the partial lesion walking well before the other hindlimb. Thus, the complete spinalization revealed that the spinal CPG underwent plastic changes after the partial lesions, which were shaped by locomotor training. Over time, with further treadmill training, the asymmetry disappeared and a bilateral locomotion was reinstated. Therefore, although remnant intact descending pathways must contribute to voluntary goal-oriented locomotion after partial SCI, the recovery and re-expression of the hindlimb locomotor pattern mostly results from intrinsic changes below the lesion in the CPG and afferent inputs.},

  Abstract                 = {Sensory neurons enable neural circuits to generate behaviors appropriate for the current environmental situation. Here, we characterize the actions of a population (about 60) of bilaterally symmetric bipolar neurons identified within the inner wall of the cardiac gutter, a foregut structure in the crab Cancer borealis. These neurons, called the ventral cardiac neurons (VCNs), project their axons through the crab stomatogastric nervous system to influence neural circuits associated with feeding. Brief pressure application to the cardiac gutter transiently modulated the filtering motor pattern (pyloric rhythm) generated by the pyloric circuit within the stomatogastric ganglion (STG). This modulation included an increased speed of the pyloric rhythm and a concomitant decrease in the activity of the lateral pyloric neuron. Furthermore, 2 min of rhythmic pressure application to the cardiac gutter elicited a chewing motor pattern (gastric mill rhythm) generated by the gastric mill circuit in the STG that persisted for < or =30 min. These sensory actions on the pyloric and gastric mill circuits were mimicked by either ventral cardiac nerve or dorsal posterior esophageal nerve stimulation. VCN actions on the STG circuits required the activation of projection neurons in the commissural ganglia. A subset of the VCN actions on these projection neurons appeared to be direct and cholinergic. We propose that the VCN neurons are mechanoreceptors that are activated when food stored in the foregut applies an outward force, leading to the long-lasting activation of projection neurons required to initiate chewing and modify the filtering of chewed food.},

V. Swindale, Dept. of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of British Columbia, 2550 Willow St., Vancouver, BC V5Z 3N9, Canada (E-mail: swindale{at}interchange.ubc.ca)Submitted 28 September 2004.Accepted 14 November 2004.Abstract We developed a variety of 54-channel high-density silicon electrode arrays (polytrodes) designed to record from large numbers of neurons spanning millimeters of brain. In cat visual cortex, it was possible to make simultaneous recordings from \&gt;100 well-isolated neurons. Using standard clustering methods, polytrodes provide a quality of single-unit isolation that surpasses that attainable with tetrodes. Guidelines for successful in vivo recording and precise electrode positioning are described. We also describe a high-bandwidth continuous data-acquisition system designed specifically for polytrodes and an automated impedance meter for testing polytrode site integrity. Despite having smaller interconnect pitches than earlier silicon-based electrodes of this type, these polytrodes have negligible channel crosstalk, comparable reliability, and low site impedances and are capable of making high-fidelity multiunit recordings with minimal tissue damage. The relatively benign nature of planar electrode arrays is evident both histologically and in experiments where the polytrode was repeatedly advanced and retracted hundreds of microns over periods of many hours. It was possible to maintain stable recordings from active neurons adjacent to the polytrode without change in their absolute positions, neurophysiological or receptive field properties.

  Abstract                 = {Neuronal circuits underlying rhythmic behaviors (central pattern generators: CPGs) can generate rhythmic motor output without sensory input. However, sensory input is pivotal for generating behaviorally relevant \{CPG\} output. Here we discuss recent work in the decapod crustacean stomatogastric nervous system (STNS) identifying cellular and synaptic mechanisms whereby sensory inputs select particular motor outputs from \{CPG\} circuits. This includes several examples in which sensory neurons regulate the impact of descending projection neurons on \{CPG\} circuits. This level of analysis is possible in the \{STNS\} due to the relatively unique access to identified circuit, projection, and sensory neurons. These studies are also revealing additional degrees of freedom in sensorimotor integration that underlie the extensive flexibility intrinsic to rhythmic motor systems. },

The manuscript reviews some of the principles relevant to the functional organization of the mammalian locomotor network and mainly focuses on mechanisms involved in rhythmogenesis.

It can be used to recover fluctuations of membrane potential from individual neurons in multiple-detector optical recordings. There are some examples in which more than 100 neurons can be separated simultaneously. Independent component analysis automatically separates overlapping action potentials, recovers action potentials of different sizes from the same neuron, removes artifacts and finds the position of each neuron on the detector array. One limitation is that the number of sources--neurons and artifacts--must be equal to or less than the number of simultaneous recordings. Independent component analysis also has many other applications in neuroscience including, removal of artifacts from EEG data, identification of spatially independent brain regions in fMRI recordings and determination of population codes in multi-unit recordings.},

Intracellular recordings of layer II/III pyramidal neurons were obtained from adult ferret visual cortical slices maintained in vitro to investigate the ionic mechanisms by which a subgroup of these cells generates repetitive, high-frequency burst discharges, a pattern referred to as “chattering.” The generation of each but the first action potential in a burst was dependent on the critical interplay between the afterhyperpolarizations (AHPs) and afterdepolarizations (ADPs) that followed each action potential. The spike-afterdepolarization and the generation of action potential bursts were dependent on Na+, but not Ca2+, currents. Neither blocking of the transmembrane flow of Ca2+nor the intracellular chelation of free Ca2+ with BAPTA inhibited the generation of intrinsic bursts. In contrast, decreasing the extracellular Na+ concentration or pharmacologically blocking Na+ currents with tetrodotoxin, QX-314, or phenytoin inhibited bursting before inhibiting action potential generation. Additionally, a subset of layer II/III pyramidal neurons could be induced to switch from repetitive single spiking to a burst-firing mode by constant depolarizing current injection, by raising extracellular K+concentrations, or by potentiation of the persistent Na+ current with the Na+ channel toxin ATX II. These results indicate that cortical neurons may dynamically regulate their pattern of action potential generation through control of Na+ and K+currents. The generation of high-frequency burst discharges may strongly influence the response of postsynaptic neurons and the operation of local cortical networks.},

The two pyloric dilator (PD) neurons are active in the pyloric rhythm, have somata in the STG, and send axons many centimeters to innervate muscles of the stomach. Dopamine application to the stomatogastric nervous system when the PD neurons were rhythmically active evoked additional action potentials during the PD neuron interburst intervals. These action potentials were peripherally generated at a region between the STG and the first bilateral branch, approximately 1 cm away from the STG, and traveled antidromically to the neuropil and orthodromically to the pyloric dilator muscles. Focal applications of dopamine to the nerves showed that spikes could be initiated in almost the entire peripheral axon of the PD neurons. Dopamine also evoked spikes in isolated peripheral axons. The concentration threshold for peripheral spike initiation was at or below 10-9 m dopamine. Thus, the peripheral axon can play an important role in shaping the output signaling to the muscles by the motor neuron.},

The ionic currents in the lateral pyloric (LP) cell of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) described in the preceding paper of the rock crab Cancer borealis were fit with a set of differential equations that describe their voltage, time, and Ca2+ dependence. The voltage-dependent currents modeled are a delayed rectifier-like current, id; a Ca(2+)-activated outward current, io(Ca); a transient A-like current, iA; a Ca2+ current, iCa; an inwardly rectifying current, ih; and a fast tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive Na+ current, iNa. 2. A single-compartment, isopotential model of the LP cell was constructed from the six voltage-dependent currents, a voltage-independent leak current il, a Ca2+ buffering system, and the membrane capacitance. 3. The behavior of the model LP neuron was compared with that of the biological neuron by simulating physiological experiments carried out in both voltage-clamp and current-clamp modes. The model and biological neurons show similar action-potential shapes, durations, steady-state current-voltage (I-V) curves, and respond to injected current in a comparable way.},

The output of a motor neuron provides a reference signal for the phase-sensitive detection of changes in fluorescence from individual neurons in a ganglion. We identify known and possibly novel neurons that participate in the swim rhythm and determine their phases within a cycle. A variant of this approach is used to identify the postsynaptic followers of intracellularly stimulated neurons. },

  Abstract                 = {Irregular intrinsic behavior of neurons seems ubiquitous in the nervous system. Even in circuits specialized to provide periodic and reliable patterns to control the repetitive activity of muscles, such as the pyloric central pattern generator (CPG) of the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion (STG), many bursting motor neurons present irregular activity when deprived from synaptic inputs. Moreover, many authors attribute to these irregularities the role of providing flexibility and adaptation capabilities to oscillatory neural networks such as CPGs. These irregular behaviors, related to nonlinear and chaotic properties of the cells, pose serious challenges to developing deterministic Hodgkin-Huxley-type (HH-type) conductance models. Only a few deterministic HH-type models based on experimental conductance values were able to show such nonlinear properties, but most of these models are based on slow oscillatory dynamics of the cytosolic calcium concentration that were never found experimentally in STG neurons. Based on an up-to-date single-compartment deterministic HH-type model of a STG neuron, we developed a stochastic HH-type model based on the microscopic Markovian states that an ion channel can achieve. We used tools from nonlinear analysis to show that the stochastic model is able to express the same kind of irregularities, sensitivity to initial conditions, and low dimensional dynamics found in the neurons isolated from the STG. Without including any nonrealistic dynamics in our whole cell stochastic model, we show that the nontrivial dynamics of the membrane potential naturally emerge from the interplay between the microscopic probabilistic character of the ion channels and the nonlinear interactions among these elements. Moreover, the experimental irregular behavior is reproduced by the stochastic model for the same parameters for which the membrane potential of the original deterministic model exhibits periodic oscillations.},

The Hodgkin-Huxley model established a framework in which to describe the structural and functional properties of ion channels, including the mechanisms of ion permeation, selectivity, and gating. At a cellular level, the model is used to understand the conditions that control both the rate and timing of action potentials, essential for neural encoding of information. Finally, the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism is central to computational neuroscience to understand both neuronal integration and circuit level information processing, and how these mechanisms might have evolved to minimize energy cost.},

Using structure-based mutagenesis and neuron-based screening, we developed a family of ultrasensitive protein calcium sensors (GCaMP6) that outperformed other sensors in cultured neurons and in zebrafish, flies and mice in vivo. In layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of the mouse visual cortex, GCaMP6 reliably detected single action potentials in neuronal somata and orientation-tuned synaptic calcium transients in individual dendritic spines. The orientation tuning of structurally persistent spines was largely stable over timescales of weeks. Orientation tuning averaged across spine populations predicted the tuning of their parent cell. Although the somata of GABAergic neurons showed little orientation tuning, their dendrites included highly tuned dendritic segments (5-40-Âµm long). GCaMP6 sensors thus provide new windows into the organization and dynamics of neural circuits over multiple spatial and temporal scales.},

Activity patterns across and within the laminae of the olfactory bulb were analyzed by imaging voltage-sensitive dye responses during odorant stimulation of all or part of the ventral olfactory mucosa. 2. The time course of the signals was generally characterized by a brief, small hyperpolarization, followed by a period of depolarization, and then a longer-lasting hyperpolarization similar to that seen with electric stimulation but with longer durations. 3. The activity was distributed nonhomogeneously across the bulbar laminae in the form of spatially segregated clusters having bandlike appearances. Clusters were observed with three monomolecular odorants, amyl acetate, ethyl-n-butyrate, and limonene, and with the complex odor of meal worms. Although response patterns to different odorants overlapped, they also showed differences in overall distribution. 4. Delivery of high odorant concentrations increased the size of the activated areas and accentuated the degree of response pattern overlap among different odorants. The general properties of the response patterns generated by each odorant were, however, similar at different odorant concentrations and in each of the animals tested. 5. The spatial and temporal distributions of the bulbar responses were somewhat similar regardless of whether the odorants were applied to local epithelial regions via punctate stimulation or to the entire mucosa. Certain regions did, however, have lower thresholds than others for eliciting bulbar activity in response to particular odorants. 6. Odorants applied to regions of the epithelium outside the areas of maximum sensitivity elicited odorant-related activity patterns with depolarizing and hyperpolarizing components similar to those seen with overall stimulation, but only if higher concentrations were used. Activation of distributed odorant sensitivities presumably gave rise to these patterns. 7. These data suggest that subsets of odorant receptor types are found in different areas of the olfactory epithelium, and demonstrate that there is widespread distribution across the epithelium of receptors sensitive to particular odorants. On the basis of the structure of these epithelial fields and the bulb response patterns that they relate to, these findings also provide evidence for complex spatial relationships between the olfactory epithelium and bulb. 8. The findings from this study suggest that representation of odor information in the salamander olfactory bulb does not occur by activation of a few selective bulbar regions, each related to a different odorant species. Instead, large regions of bulbar circuitry are involved in which molecular epitopes may be the unit of representation. Incorporation of new data presented here into a hypothesis of odor coding is discussed. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1995 the American Physiological Society},

  Abstract                 = {A. R. Cinelli and J. S. Kauer1Department of Neurosurgery, Tufts Medical School, Boston,Massachusetts, USA.Abstract 1. Video imaging of changes in voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) fluorescence was used to analyze spatial and temporal properties of activity patterns in the in vivo salamander olfactory bulb and primordium piriform cortex after electric stimulation. Distribution of activity among and within the neuronal layers was analyzed after orthodromic stimulation of the whole olfactory nerve (ON), isolated fascicles, or local epithelial sites, and after antidromic stimulation of the medial olfactory tract (OT). 2. Optical signals propagated through the bulbar layers with a sequence that correlates with electrophysiological responses. After orthodromic stimulation, VSD responses started in the glomerular layer, spread to the deeper laminae, and, after reaching the region of mitral/tufted somata, were observed as a brief burst of activity in the OT. Compound action potentials in the ON were associated with short-duration, rapidly depolarizing optical responses in the ON layer. Responses in glomerular layer and external plexiform layer (EPL) first showed in some recordings a brief, small-amplitude hyperpolarization, followed by a period of depolarization, followed by a second, longer-lasting hyperpolarization. The periods of optical hyperpolarization could be related to events observed in intracellular mitral/tufted cell recordings. 3. With shocks delivered to the entire ON, depolarizing responses were nonhomogeneously distributed, appearing as multiple foci or bands of activity. Spatial patterns within each bulbar layer had poorly defined borders. Sites showing short-latency responses were often those with the largest and longest-lasting activity. 4. Increasing the intensity of stimulation to the ON enhanced the size and duration of the depolarizing and hyperpolarizing responses. The short-latency, early hyperpolarization was best seen with low-intensity, peripherally placed stimuli. 5. ON stimulation also elicited activity in the contralateral bulb. Activity started at the innermost layers and spread in patches to regions of the EPL just beneath the glomeruli. These had durations similar to ipsilateral responses, but longer latencies. A period of early hyperpolarization, longer than that on the ipsilateral side, was followed by prolonged depolarization and then by a second, later hyperpolarization. 6. Antidromic stimuli applied to the OT evoked optical responses consisting of a period of depolarization followed by hyperpolarization, similar to the components elicited by orthodromic stimuli. These responses had short time courses, began in the deeper layers, and spread to the superficial region of the bulb usually without reaching the glomerular region. 7. Punctate stimulation of the mucosa or nerve elicited depolarizing and hyperpolarizing events that depended on the stimulation site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) Copyright {\textcopyright} 1995 the American Physiological Society},

  Abstract                 = {A. R. Cinelli, S. R. Neff, and J. S. Kauer1Department of Neurosurgery, Tufts Medical School, Boston,Massachusetts, USA.Abstract 1. In this paper we describe properties of a video imaging system used to acquire voltage-sensitive dye fluorescence signals from the salamander olfactory bulb. Sources of noise in these signals were evaluated in preparations stained with the potentiometric probe RH-414. These were compared with noise levels in signals obtained from a light-emitting diode array designed to stimulate the experimental conditions with light levels similar to those seen in the salamander bulb recordings. These experiments define a number of determinants of video image quality to standardize optical voltage measurements in the salamander olfactory bulb. 2. Images were acquired at video rates using a Newvicon camera in a standard upright microscope and digitized with an eight-bit video frame grabber. 3. Sources of noise related to camera sensitivity, stability of illumination, and mechanical vibration were characterized. Camera dark noise was less than the pixel variability due to photon noise at the camera faceplate. This pixel noise was the limiting factor for discriminating the spatial and temporal properties of the optical responses. 4. No significant noise was found to be related to image digitization, transmission, or readout by the eight-bit frame grabber. Mechanical vibration, light stability, and other sources of noise could be controlled in vitro. In this condition, voltage-sensitive dye signal noise was similar to that in stimulated experiments using the light-emitting diode array. Higher levels of noise were found in vivo; some of this was reduced by sychronizing frame acquisition to the heartbeat. 5. On the basis of photodiode and video measurements, voltage-sensitive dye responses in the salamander olfactory bulb typically fell between 0.75\% and 2.5\% fractional change of background fluorescence. By appropriately adjusting the video signals before analog-to-digital conversion, we could detect fractional changes of \&lt; 0.5\%. 6. Both response averaging and low-bandpass spatial filtering improved the signal-to-noise ratios of the images. For small numbers of averaged runs, the best improvement was obtained by low-bandpass spatial filtering. 7. Acquisition of high-spatial resolution video images permitted the use of low-bandpass spatial filters to suppress pixel noise. The degree of spatial enhancement depended on the relationship between the size of the structures of interest, pixel density, and the properties of the convolution filter kernel. This method avoided exposure of the preparation to prolonged illumination and the necessity of applying the large numbers of repeated stimuli required for averaging.

Dopamine (DA) differentially modulates neurons within the pyloric network. However, while the electrophysiological actions of DA have been well characterized, nothing is known about the signaling events that mediate its effects. We have begun a molecular characterization of DA receptors (DARs) in this invertebrate system. Here, we describe the cloning and characterization of the lobster D2 receptor, D2?Pan. We found that when expressed in HEK cells, the D2?Pan receptor is activated by DA, but not other monoamines endogenous to the lobster nervous system. This receptor positively couples with cAMP through multiple Gi/o proteins via two discrete pathways: 1) a G? mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (AC), leading to a decrease in cAMP and 2) a G?? mediated activation of Phospholipase C? (PLC?), leading to an increase in cAMP. Alternate splicing alters the potency and efficacy of the receptor, but does not affect monoamine specificity. Finally, we show that arthropod D2 receptor coupling with cAMP varies with the cellular milieu.},

As a first step toward illuminating the molecular underpinnings of dopaminergic signal transduction in the crustacean STNS, we have cloned and characterized two type-one DA receptors (DARs) from the spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus): D(1alphaPan) and D(1betaPan). We found that the structure and function of these arthropod DARs are well conserved across species. Using a heterologous expression system, we determined that DA, but not serotonin, octopamine, tyramine or histamine activates these receptors.

  Title                    = {Cellular/Molecular Arthropod 5-HT 2 Receptors: A Neurohormonal Receptor in Decapod Crustaceans That Displays Agonist Independent Activity Resulting from an Evolutionary Alteration to the DRY},
  Abstract                 = {The stomatogastric nervous system (STNS) is a premiere model for studying modulation of motor pattern generation. Whereas the cellular and network responses to monoamines have been particularly well characterized electrophysiologically, the transduction mechanisms that link the different monoaminergic signals to specific intracellular responses are presently unknown in this system. To begin to elucidate monoaminergic signal transduction in pyloric neurons, we used a bioinformatics approach to predict the existence of 18 monoamine receptors in arthropods, 9 of which have been previously cloned in Drosophila and other insects. We then went on to use the two existing insect databases to clone and characterize the 10th putative arthropod receptor from the spiny lobster, Panulirus interruptus. This receptor is most homologous to the 5-HT2 subtype and shows a dose-dependent response to 5-HT but not to any of the other monoamines present in the STNS. Through a series of pharmacological experiments, we demonstrate that this newly described receptor, 5-HT2?Pan, couples with the traditional Gq pathway when expressed in HEK293 cells, but not to Gs or Gi/o. Moreover, it is constitutively active, because the highly conserved DRY motif in transmembrane region 3 has evolved into DRF. Site-directed mutagenesis that reverts the motif back to DRY abolishes this agonist-independent activity. We further demonstrate that this receptor most likely participates in the modulation of stomatogastric motor output, because it is found in neurites in the synaptic neuropil of the stomatogastric ganglion as well as in the axon terminals at identified pyloric neuromuscular junctions.},

  Abstract                 = {The large number of variables involved in many biophysical models can conceal potentially simple dynamical mechanisms governing the properties of its solutions and the transitions between them as parameters are varied. To address this issue, we extend a novel model reduction method, based on "scales of dominance," to multi-compartment models. We use this method to systematically reduce the dimension of a two-compartment conductance-based model of a crustacean pyloric dilator (PD) neuron that exhibits distinct modes of oscillation--tonic spiking, intermediate bursting and strong bursting. We divide trajectories into intervals dominated by a smaller number of variables, resulting in a locally reduced hybrid model whose dimension varies between two and six in different temporal regimes. The reduced model exhibits the same modes of oscillation as the 16 dimensional model over a comparable parameter range, and requires fewer ad hoc simplifications than a more traditional reduction to a single, globally valid model. The hybrid model highlights low-dimensional organizing structure in the dynamics of the PD neuron, and the dependence of its oscillations on parameters such as the maximal conductances of calcium currents. Our technique could be used to build hybrid low-dimensional models from any large multi-compartment conductance-based model in order to analyze the interactions between different modes of activity.},

One goal was to find fluorescence changes related to the increases in membrane conductance that underlie propagation. A second goal was to find large changes in fluorescence that would allow optical monitoring of membrane potential in neurons and other cells. Attempts were made to measure fluorescence changes using over 300 different fluorescent molecules and positive results were obtained with more than half of these. No evidence was found that would relate, any of the fluorescence changes to the increases in membrane conductance that accompany depolarization; most, instead, were correlated with the changes in membrane potential. The fluorescence changes of several dyes were relatively large; the largest changes during an action potential were 10−3 of the resting intensity. They could be measured with a signal-to-noise ratio of better than 10∶1 in a single sweep.},

  Abstract                 = {Alternating current impedance measurements have been made over a wide frequency range on the giant axon from the stellar nerve of the squid, Loligo pealii, during the passage of a nerve impulse. The transverse impedance was measured between narrow electrodes on either side of the axon with a Wheatstone bridge having an amplifier and cathode ray oscillograph for detector. When the bridge was balanced, the resting axon gave a narrow line on the oscillograph screen as a sweep circuit moved the spot across. As an impulse passed between impedance electrodes after the axon had been stimulated at one end, the oscillograph line first broadened into a band, indicating a bridge unbalance, and then narrowed down to balance during recovery. From measurements made during the passage of the impulse and appropriate analysis, it was found that the membrane phase angle was unchanged, the membrane capacity decreased about 2 per cent, while the membrane conductance fell from a resting value of 1000 ohm cm.2 to an average of 25 ohm cm.2The onset of the resistance change occurs somewhat after the start of the monophasic action potential, but coincides quite closely with the point of inflection on the rising phase, where the membrane current reverses in direction, corresponding to a decrease in the membrane electromotive force. This E.M.F. and the conductance are closely associated properties of the membrane, and their sudden changes constitute, or are due to, the activity which is responsible for the all-or-none law and the initiation and propagation of the nerve impulse. These results correspond to those previously found for Nitella and lead us to expect similar phenomena in other nerve fibers.},

The chapter discusses the statistical mechanical analysis of neuronal firing processes in recurrent networks with static synapsesâ€”that is, network operation as opposed to network learning. The chapter discusses and solves various members of the simplest class of models: (1) the Hopfield model, which is the archetypical model to describe the functioning of symmetric neural networks as associative memories and to a coupled oscillator model storing phase patterns and (2) a model with Gaussian synapses, where the number of attractors diverges to introduce the so-called replica method. },

  Abstract                 = {Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on solving the dynamics of recurrent neural networks using nonequilibrium statistical mechanical techniques. It introduces recurrent neural networks and their properties. The chapter starts with relatively simple networks, with a small number of attractors (such as systems with uniform synapses or with a small number of patterns stored with Hebbian-type rules), which can be solved with relatively simple mathematical techniques. The chapter shows how to solve the dynamics of fully connected as well as extremely diluted networks, emphasizing on the crucial issue of presence (or absence) of synaptic symmetry and compares the predictions of the (exact) generating functional formalism to both numerical simulations and simple approximate theories. Any finite degree of synaptic symmetry, whether in a fully connected or in an extremely diluted attractor network, immediately generates an effective retarded self-interaction in the dynamics that is responsible for highly nontrivial â€œglassyâ€� dynamics. },

  Abstract                 = {The perception of proprioceptive signals that report the internal state of the body is one of the essential tasks of the nervous system and helps to continuously adapt body movements to changing circumstances. Despite the impact of proprioceptive feedback on motor activity it has rarely been studied in conditions in which motor output and sensory activity interact as they do in behaving animals, i.e., in closed-loop conditions. The interaction of motor and sensory activities, however, can create emergent properties that may govern the functional characteristics of the system. We here demonstrate a method to use a well-characterized model system for central pattern generation, the stomatogastric nervous system, for studying these properties in vitro. We created a real-time computer model of a single-cell muscle tendon organ in the gastric mill of the crab foregut that uses intracellular current injections to control the activity of the biological proprioceptor. The resulting motor output of a gastric mill motor neuron is then recorded intracellularly and fed into a simple muscle model consisting of a series of low-pass filters. The muscle output is used to activate a one-dimensional Hodgkinâ€“Huxley type model of the muscle tendon organ in real-time, allowing closed-loop conditions. Model properties were either hand tuned to achieve the best match with data from semi-intact muscle preparations, or an exhaustive search was performed to determine the best set of parameters. We report the real-time capabilities of our models, its performance and its interaction with the biological motor system.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper shows to what extent an average-response
computer can be utilized for computing a cross-correlation function.
This type of computer needs synchronization pulses, and the sim-
plest methods of computation are those in which these pulses are
directly derived from one of the signals (triggered correlation). The
first method is to generate a synchronization pulse whenever the
signal crosses a pre-set threshold in any direction. In this case, the
computer output function is shown to be proportional to the true cor-
relation function, for Gaussian signals. In a second method, syn-
chronization pulses are produced when the signal crosses the thresh-
old in a specified (e.g., positive) direction. Then the computer output
is found to be contaminated by a systematic error, which, in turn,
depends on the derivative of the correlation function. These two
methods are described in detail, both with respect to the results and
to the accuracy obtainable. Several other, less important, methods
are only briefly described.
The second method (single-direction triggered correlation) is the
simplest and most attractive one. Its feasibility is shown by means of
a practical example. It is also useful in the analysis of compound sys-
tems, namely, systems that consist of a linear circuit followed by a
triggering and pulse-forming circuit. In this respect, the method can
be, and, as a matter of fact, has been applied to problems like the
excitation of nerve impulses in sensory organs. Such an application is
briefly described.},

Neurally released peptides can diffuse long distances to bind to their receptors. Hence, different neurons releasing the same neuropeptide into the same neuropil may reach the same receptor complement. However, extracellular peptidases can limit neuropeptide diffusion and terminate its actions. Distinct versions of the pyloric rhythm are elicited by selective activation of different projection neurons, including those with overlapping sets of cotransmitters. Two of these projection neurons, modulatory commissural neuron 1 (MCN1) and the modulatory proctolin neuron (MPN), contain the neuropeptide proctolin plus GABA. MCN1 also contains Cancer borealis},

In particular, at early stages of development the intact larva is an ideal system to apply optical techniques for deep imaging in the nervous system, as well as genetically encoded tools for targeting subsets of neurons and monitoring and manipulating their activity. For these applications, new genetically encoded optical tools, fluorescent sensors, and light-gated channels have been generated, creating the field of â€œoptogenetics.â€� It is now possible to monitor and control neuronal activity with minimal perturbation and unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution. We describe here the main achievements that have occurred in the last decade in imaging and manipulating neuronal activity in intact zebrafish larvae.

  Abstract                 = {Sensory processing and its perception require that local information would also be available globally. Indeed, in the mammalian neocortex, local excitation spreads over large distances via the long-range horizontal connections in layer 2/3 and may spread over an entire cortical area if excitatory polysynaptic pathways are also activated. Therefore, a balance between local excitation and surround inhibition is required. Here we explore the spatiotemporal aspects of cortical depolarization and hyperpolarization of rats anesthetized with urethane. New voltage-sensitive dyes (VSDs) were used for high-resolution real-time visualization of the cortical responses to whisker deflections and cutaneous stimulations of the whisker pad. These advances facilitated imaging of ongoing activity and evoked responses even without signal averaging. We found that the motion of a single whisker evoked a cortical response exhibiting either one or three phases. During a triphasic response, there was first a cortical depolarization in a small cortical region the size of a single cortical barrel. Subsequently, this depolarization increased and spread laterally in an oval manner, preferentially along rows of the barrel field. During the second phase, the amplitude of the evoked response declined rapidly, presumably because of recurrent inhibition. Subsequently, the third phase exhibiting a depolarization rebound was observed and clear, and âˆ¼16 Hz oscillations were detected. Stimulus conditions revealing a net surround hyperpolarization during the second phase were also found. By using new, improved VSD, the present findings shed new light on the spatial parameters of the intricate spatiotemporal cortical interplay of inhibition and excitation.},

The extensive repertoire of such resulting motor patterns in dietary generalists is hypothesized to permit these animals to process varied foods. The foregut and STNS of Pugettia producta are similar to those of other decapods, but its diet is more uniform, consisting primarily of kelp. We investigated the distribution of highly conserved neuromodulators in the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) and neuroendocrine organs of Pugettia, and documented their effects on its pyloric rhythm. Using immunohistochemistry, we found that the distributions of Cancer borealis tachykinin-related peptide I (CabTRP I), crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP), proctolin, red pigment concentrating hormone (RPCH) and tyrosine hydroxylase (dopamine) were similar to those of other decapods. For all peptides except proctolin, the isoforms responsible for the immunoreactivity were confirmed by mass spectrometry to be the authentic peptides. Only two modulators had physiological effects on the pyloric circuit similar to those seen in other species. In non-rhythmic preparations, proctolin and the muscarinic acetylcholine agonist oxotremorine consistently initiated a full pyloric rhythm. Dopamine usually activated a pyloric rhythm, but this pattern was highly variable. In only about 25% of preparations, RPCH activated a pyloric rhythm similar to that seen in other species. CCAP and CabTRP I had no effect on the pyloric rhythm. Thus, whereas Pugettia possesses all the neuromodulators investigated, its pyloric rhythm, when compared with other decapods, appears less sensitive to many of them, perhaps because of its limited diet.},

An electrical train of stimuli applied over the second lumbar segment with a frequency of 25 to 60 Hz and an amplitude of 5-9 V was effective in inducing rhythmic, alternating stance and swing phases of the lower limbs. This finding suggests that spinal circuitry in humans has the capability of generating locomotor-like activity even when isolated from brain control, and that externally controlled sustained electrical stimulation of the spinal cord can replace the tonic drive generated by the brain.},

In both driven and autonomous chaotic systems, the motion (or orbit) of the system in phase space can at times be almost periodic. Unstable periodic orbits can also be used for the anticontrol (or maintenance) of chaos. By analyzing the \{UPOs\} in the region of either transition, small perturbations can be used to lock the system's dynamics into one basin of attraction. The study of \{UPOs\} has enabled researchers in the field of nonlinear dynamics to work with short and noisy sets of nonlinear data. This allows the study of biological systems, which noise and nonstationarity had previously made intractable. The methods described in the chapter are very robust to the presence of dynamical noise and can operate on extremely short data files. They are also demonstrated to be capable of distinguishing between dynamical data and colored noise, something that is difficult for more traditional nonlinear techniques even when very long data files are available. },

In the current study, we investigated the effects of 8-OH-DPAT on bladder capacity and external urethral sphincter (EUS) activity in urethane-anesthetized female rats (initial body mass 175{\textendash}200 g) with chronic spinal cord injury (transsection at T10). Cystometric study took place 8{\textendash}12 wk posttranssection. Intravesical pressure was monitored in urethane-anesthetized rats with a transvesical catheter, and EUS activity was assessed electromyographically. Spinal cord injury disrupts phasic activity of the EUS, resulting in decreased voiding efficiency and increased residual volume. 8-OH-DPAT induced a dose-dependent decrease in bladder capacity (the opposite of its effect in chronic spinal cord-injured cats) with an increase in micturition volume and decrease in residual volume resulting from improvement in voiding efficiency. The unexpected improvement in voiding efficiency can be explained by the 8-OH-DPAT-induced emergence of phasic EUS relaxation. Phasic EUS relaxation was also altered by 8-OH-DPAT in spinally intact rats, whereas the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist N-tert-butyl-3-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-2-phenylpropanamide (WAY-100635), on its own, was without effect. It remains to be determined when phasic relaxation is restored after spinal cord injury, and indeed whether it is ever truly lost or is only temporarily separated from excitatory input. bladdermicturitionneurogenic voidingdetrusorurethraCopyright {\textcopyright} 2007 the American Physiological Society},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding the spatio-temporal features of the information processing occurring in any complex neural structure requires the monitoring and analysis of the activity in populations of neurons. Electrophysiological and other mapping techniques have provided important insights into the function of neural circuits and neural populations in many systems. However, there remain limitations with these approaches. Therefore, complementary techniques which permit the monitoring of the spatio-temporal activity in neuronal populations are of continued interest. One promising approach to monitor the electrical activity in populations of neurons or on multiple sites of a single neuron is with voltage-sensitive dyes coupled with optical recording techniques. This review concentrates on the use of voltage-sensitive dyes and optical imaging as tools to study the activity in neuronal populations in the central nervous system. Focusing on ‘fast’ voltage-sensitive dyes first, several technical issues and developments in optical imaging will be reviewed. These will include more recent developments in voltage-sensitive dyes as well as newer developments in optical recording technology. Second, studies using voltage-sensitive dyes to investigate information processing questions in the central nervous system and in the invertebrate nervous system will be reviewed. Some emphasis will be placed on the cerebellum, but the major goal is to survey how voltage-sensitive dyes and optical recordings have been utilized in the central nervous system. The review will include optical studies on the visual, auditory, olfactory, somatosensory, auditory, hippocampal and brainstem systems, as well as single cell studies addressing information processing questions. Discussion of the intrinsic optical signals is also included. The review attempts to show how voltage-sensitive dyes and optical recordings can be used to obtain high spatial and temporal resolution monitoring of neuronal activity. },

  Abstract                 = {Recent advances in electrophysiological techniques have created new tools for the acquisition and storage of neuronal activity recorded simultaneously with numerous electrodes. These techniques support the analysis of the function as well as the structure of individual electrogenic cells in the context of surrounding neuronal or cardiac network. Commercially available tools for the analysis of such data, however, cannot be easily adapted to newly emerging requirements for data analysis and visualization, and cross compatibility between them is limited. In this report we introduce a free open source toolbox called microelectrode array tools (MEA-Tools) for the analysis of multi-electrode data based on the common data analysis environment matlab (version 5.3–6.1, The Mathworks, Natick, MA). The toolbox itself is platform independent. The file interface currently supports files recorded with \{MCRack\} (Multi Channel Systems, Reutlingen, Germany) under Microsoft Windows 95, 98, NT, and 2000, but can be adapted to other data acquisition systems. Functions are controlled via command line input and graphical user interfaces, and support common requirements for the analysis of local field potentials, extracellular spike activity, and continuous recordings, in addition to supplementary data acquired by additional instruments, e.g. intracellular amplifiers. Data may be processed as continuous recordings or time windows triggered to some event. },

  Abstract                 = {1. The pyloric dilator (PD) and anterior burster (AB) neurons in the pyloric system of the lobster stomatogastric ganglion are electrically coupled and synchronously active. We have used the lucifer yellow photoinactivation technique to separate the connections made by the PD motor neurons from those made by the AB interneuron. 2. Photoinactivation of either the two PD neurons or the single AB neuron allowed us to separate the compound inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in the lateral pyloric (LP) and pyloric (PY) motor neurons resulting from synchronous PD and AB activity into AB-evoked and PD-evoked components. These IPSPs have different time courses, reversal potentials, ion selectivities, and pharmacological properties. 3. Photoinactivation and membrane-potential manipulations indicated that a readily observable IPSP recorded in the AB neuron and correlated with action potentials in the LP neuron is actually an electrotonic potential due to an LP-evoked IPSP in the PD neurons. 4. Selective inactivation of either the two PD neurons or the AB neuron revealed that the IPSP recorded in the ventricular dilator (VD) motor neuron is due solely to AB-released transmitter. 5. The electrical coupling potentials measurable between the AB, PD, and VD neuron somata are due to direct electrical coupling between all of these neurons. 6. Circuit analysis and transmitter identification may be complicated by electrical coupling. We suggest that the presence of electrical coupling between nonidentical neurons may provide a new mechanism that allows changes in synaptic characteristics among neurons within a "hard-wired" circuit.},

  Abstract                 = {Intracellular recordings were made from rhythm-generating interneurons in the Lymnaea feeding system. The feeding pattern is a three-phase rhythm of interneuronal activity (N1, N2, N3) corresponding to protraction, rasp, and swallow. We describe the firing pattern and anatomy of the premotor interneurons, each of which fires a predominant burst in only one phase of the feeding rhythm. The rhythm can be driven by steady depolarization of N1 cells. The phase of the rhythm is reset by brief stimulation of N2 or N3 interneurons. N1 neurons excite the N2 interneurons, and these in turn inhibit the N1 cells. This recurrent inhibitory pathway can account for the switch from the N1 phase of the feeding cycles to the N2 phase. The endogenous properties of the N2 interneurons are apparently responsible for the termination of N2 bursts. N3 interneurons display postinhibitory rebound (PIR), and this probably contributes to their burst after the end of the N2 inhibitory input. N2 and N3 interneurons inhibit the N1 cells. When the N3 burst dies away, activity in N1 cells resumes under the stimulus of depolarizing current. Interactions between interneurons are mainly by discrete, monophasic postsynaptic potentials, that follow 1:1. They have relatively short latency (2-12 ms) and duration (up to 100 ms). The synaptic connections between the three types of premotor interneurons are sufficient to account for the sequence of activity seen during feeding.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Tremendous advances have occurred in recent years in elucidating basic mechanisms of epilepsy at the level of ion channels and neurotransmitters. Epilepsy, however, is ultimately a disease of functionally and/or structurally aberrant connections between neurons and groups of neurons at the systems level. Recent advances in neuroimaging and electrophysiology now make it possible to investigate structural and functional connectivity of the entire brain, and these techniques are currently being used to investigate diseases that manifest as global disturbances of brain function. Epilepsy is such a disease, and our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of epilepsy and the generation of epileptic seizures will undoubtedly benefit from research utilizing these connectomic approaches. RECENT FINDINGS: MRI using diffusion tensor imaging provides structural information, whereas functional MRI and electroencephalography provide functional information about connectivity at the whole brain level. Optogenetics, tracers, electrophysiological approaches, and calcium imaging provide connectivity information at the level of local circuits. These approaches are revealing important neuronal network disturbances underlying epileptic abnormalities. SUMMARY: An understanding of the fundamental mechanisms underlying the development of epilepsy and the generation of epileptic seizures will require delineation of the aberrant functional and structural connections of the whole brain. The field of connectomics now provides approaches to accomplish this.},

  Abstract                 = {Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on the emergence of feature selectivity from lateral interactions in the visual cortex. The tuning properties of neurons responding to oriented moving stimuli result from the interplay between excitation on a short length scale and inhibition dominating at larger distances. The chapter reviews models for the dynamics of activities in cortex that are based on stereotyped intracortical interactions. These models stood at the very beginning of the mathematical description of collective phenomena in the brain. The dynamics of these models may have far-reaching consequences and explains a variety of experimental findings. The chapter shows that they might provide a novel explanation for the early development of feature maps in the visual cortex. In chains and two-dimensional neuronal layers, a Mexican-hat shaped coupling induces localized activation patterns. This simple dynamics can be related to response properties of neurons in primary visual cortex. The chapter shows that this approach can also explain the shape of orientation and direction maps as well as the relation of columnar structures to receptive field size and movement. },

  Abstract                 = {Modulatory systems are well known for their roles in tuning the cellular and synaptic properties in the adult neuronal networks, and play a major role in the control of the flexibility of functional outputs. However far less is known concerning their role in the maturation of neural networks during the development. In this review, using the stomatogastric nervous system of lobster, we will show that the neuromodulatory system exerts a powerful influence on developing neural networks. In the adult the number of both motor target neurons and their modulatory neurons is restricted to tens of identifiable cells. They are therefore well characterized in terms of cellular, synaptic and morphological properties. In the embryo, these target cells and their neuromodulatory population are already present from mid-embryonic life. However, the motor output generated by the system is quite different: while in the embryo all the target neurons are organized into a single network generating unique motor pattern, in the adult this population splits into two distinct networks generating separate patterns. This ontogenetic partitioning does not rely on progressive acquisition of adult properties but rather on a switch between two possible network operations. Indeed, adult networks are present early in the embryonic life but their expression is repressed by central modulatory neurons. Moreover, embryonic networks can be revealed in the adult system again by altering modulatory influences. Therefore, independently of the developmental age, two potential network phenotypes co-exist within the same neuronal architecture: when one is expressed, the other one is hidden and vice versa. These transitions do not necessarily need dramatic changes such as growth/retraction of processes, acquisition of new intra-membrane proteins etc. but rather, as shown by modelling studies, it may simply rely on a subtle tuning of pre-existing intercellular electrical coupling. This in turn suggests that progressive ontogenetic alteration may not take place at the level of the target network but rather at the level of modulatory input neurons.},

Using this in vitro approach, dopamine neurons survive for an extended period of time and establish functional axon terminals and dendrites that display properties similar to those observed in vivo and in brain slices. An alternate protocol is provided for a microculture system in which astrocytes are grown on a spatially limited surface where single or small groups of dopamine neurons develop. Under such conditions, isolated neurons establish synaptic contacts, or autapses, onto their own somatodendritic compartment, thus facilitating morphological and physiological experiments. Curr.

  Abstract                 = {Epilepsy is characterized by recurrent synchronizations of neuronal activity, which are both a cardinal clinical symptom and a debilitating phenomenon. Although the temporal dynamics of epileptiform synchronizations are well described at the macroscopic level using electrophysiological approaches, less is known about how spatially distributed microcircuits contribute to these events. It is important to understand the relationship between micro and macro network activity because the various mechanisms proposed to underlie the generation of such pathological dynamics are united by the assumption that epileptic activity is recurrent and hypersynchronous across multiple scales. However, quantitative analyses of epileptiform spatial dynamics with cellular resolution have been hampered by the difficulty of simultaneously recording from multiple neurons in lesioned, adult brain tissue. We have overcome this experimental limitation and used two-photon calcium imaging in combination with a functional clustering algorithm to uncover the functional network structure of the chronically epileptic dentate gyrus in the mouse pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy. We show that, under hyperexcitable conditions, slices from the epileptic dentate gyrus display recurrent interictal-like network events with a high diversity in the activity patterns of individual neurons. Analysis reveals that multiple functional clusters of spatially localized neurons comprise epileptic networks, and that network events are composed of the coactivation of variable subsets of these clusters, which show little repetition between events. Thus, these interictal-like recurrent macroscopic events are not necessarily recurrent when viewed at the microcircuit scale and instead display a patterned but variable structure.},

The resulting â€œBVP modelâ€� has two variables of state, representing excitability and refractoriness, and qualitatively resembles Bonhoeffer's theoretical model for the iron wire model of nerve. This BVP model serves as a simple representative of a class of excitable-oscillatory systems including the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model of the squid giant axon. The BVP phase plane can be divided into regions corresponding to the physiological states of nerve fiber (resting, active, refractory, enhanced, depressed, etc.) to form a â€œphysiological state diagram,â€� with the help of which many physiological phenomena can be summarized. A properly chosen projection from the 4-dimensional HH phase space onto a plane produces a similar diagram which shows the underlying relationship between the two models. Impulse trains occur in the BVP and HH models for a range of constant applied currents which make the singular point representing the resting state unstable.},

V is the membrane potential, m the Na+ activation, h the Na+ inactivation, and n the K+ activation. V and m change rapidly, relative to h and n. The (V, m) phase plane of a reduced system of equations, with h and n held constant at their resting values, has three singular points: a stable resting point, a threshold saddle point, and a stable excited point. When h and n are allowed to vary, recovery and refractoriness result from the movement with subsequent disappearance of the threshold and excited points. Multiplying the time constant of n by 100 or more, and that of h by one-third, reproduces the experimental plateau action potentials obtained with tetraethylammonium by Tasaki and Hagiwara, including the phenomena of abolition and of refractoriness of the plateau duration. The equations have, transiently, two stable states, as found in the real axon by these authors. Since the theoretical membrane conductance curves differ significantly from the experimental ones, further experimental analysis of ionic currents with tetraethylammonium is needed to decide whether the Hodgkin-Huxley model can be generalized to explain these experiments completely.},

  Abstract                 = {R. E. Flamm and R. M. Harris-WarrickAbstract In the preceding paper, we describe how dopamine, octopamine, and serotonin modulate the neural circuit generating a well-described motor pattern, the pyloric rhythm of the stomatogastric ganglion in the spiny lobster, Panulirus interruptus. In this paper, we identify the neurons within the pyloric circuit that are directly affected by each amine. We accomplished this by isolating each pyloric neuron from all known synaptic input, using a combination of Lucifer yellow photoinactivation of presynaptic neurons and pharmacological blockade by pyloric neurotransmitters. Dopamine, octopamine, and serotonin were bath applied to the preparation, and the responses of synaptically isolated neurons were recorded. Each amine had a unique constellation of effects on the neurons of the pyloric circuit. Almost every neuron in the circuit was directly affected by each amine. Dopamine and octopamine modulated every neuron, whereas serotonin affected four of the six cell types. Each amine had multiple effects among pyloric neurons including the induction of endogenous rhythmic bursting activity, initiation or enhancement of tonic firing activity, and inhibition accompanied by hyperpolarization. All three amines induced rhythmic bursting in one neuron (the AB neuron), but the form of the underlying slow-wave membrane-potential oscillations was different with octopamine than with dopamine and serotonin. Our knowledge of the effects of each amine on each pyloric neuron, combined with the extensive knowledge of the synaptic organization of the pyloric circuit, has allowed us to explain qualitatively the major aspects of the unique variants of the pyloric motor rhythm that each amine produces in the synaptically intact circuit.

  Abstract                 = {Publisher Summary The human brain is extraordinary in the way that it can create a perception of an external stimulus using only the electric impulses transmitted to it from the sensory organ being stimulated. The topological mapping is the means by which information on the spatial relations between sensory cells is transmitted to and decoded by the brain. The principles of self-organization expressed in the self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm can be successfully generalized by (1) generalizing the concepts of the winner using different measures of similarity between the inputs, which are not necessarily vectorial in nature and (2) by changing the update rule from an incremental one, to an update based on the mean or median of some subset of the data. The tonotopic map could be explained as an anatomical projection of the basilar membrane of the inner ear, but it should also be noted that in the auditory pathway, the order of the transmitting neurons is changed before reaching the cortex. Abstract topological maps can be formed according to sensory stimulation. Topological ordering results in a form of collective responsibility through the fact that performance of the system as a whole does not depend on a single neuron. This ensures a graceful degradation of the system and gives a certain robustness. },

These Gi/o-coupled inhibitory receptors play a major part in shaping dopamine transmission. Found at both somatodendritic and axonal sites, autoreceptors regulate the firing patterns of dopamine neurons and control the timing and amount of dopamine released from their terminals in target regions. Alterations in the expression and activity of autoreceptors are thought to contribute to Parkinson’s disease as well as schizophrenia, drug addiction and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which emphasizes the importance of D2-autoreceptors in regulating the dopamine system. This review will summarize the cellular actions of dopamine autoreceptors and discuss recent advances that have furthered our understanding of the mechanisms by which D2-receptors control dopamine transmission. },

We propose three phases for the underlying oscillation for this class of cells: generation, maintenance, and termination and suggest that different current modules coregulate to preserve the characteristics of each phase. Coregulation of I(Burst) and I(A) currents within distinct boundaries maintains the dynamics during the generation phase. Similarly, coregulation of I(CaT) and I(Kd) maintains the peak and duration of the underlying oscillation, whereas the calcium-activated I(KCa) ensures appropriate termination of the oscillation and adjusts the duration independent of peak.},

  Abstract                 = {Locomotion and scratch are characterized by alternation of flexion and extension phases within one hindlimb, which are mediated by rhythm-generating circuitry within the spinal cord. By definition, the rhythm generator controls cycle period, phase durations, and phase transitions. The aim was to determine whether rhythm-generating mechanisms for locomotion and scratch are similar in adult decerebrate cats. The regulation of cycle period during fictive scratching was evaluated, as were the effects of specific sensory inputs on phase durations and transitions during spontaneous fictive locomotion and pinna-evoked fictive scratching. Results show that cycle period during fictive scratching varied predominantly with flexion phase duration, contrary to spontaneous fictive locomotion, where cycle period varied with extension phase duration. Ankle dorsiflexion greatly increased extension phase duration and cycle period during fictive locomotion but did not alter cycle period during scratching. Moreover, stimulating the plantaris (ankle extensor muscle) nerve during flexion reset the locomotor rhythm to extension but not the scratch rhythm. Stimulating the plantaris nerve during extension prolonged the extension phase and cycle period during fictive locomotion but not during fictive scratching. Stimulating the sartorius nerve (hip flexor muscle) during early flexion reduced the flexion phase and cycle period during fictive locomotion, but considerably prolonged the flexion phase and cycle period during fictive scratching. These data indicate that cycle period, phase durations, and phase transitions are not regulated similarly during fictive locomotion and scratching, with or without sensory inputs, providing evidence for specialized rhythm-generating mechanisms within the adult mammalian spinal cord.},

  Abstract                 = {While there are many instances of single neurons that can drive rhythmic stimulus-elicited motor programs, such neurons have seldom been found to be necessary for motor program function. In the isolated central nervous system of the marine mollusc Tritonia diomedea, brief stimulation (1 sec) of a peripheral nerve activates an interneuronal central pattern generator that produces the long-lasting (approximately 30-60 sec) motor program underlying the animal's rhythmic escape swim. Here, we identify a single interneuron, DRI (for dorsal ramp interneuron), that (i) conveys the sensory information from this stimulus to the swim central pattern generator, (ii) elicits the swim motor program when driven with intracellular stimulation, and (iii) blocks the depolarizing "ramp" input to the central pattern generator, and consequently the motor program itself, when hyperpolarized during the nerve stimulus. Because most of the sensory information appears to be funneled through this one neuron as it enters the pattern generator, DRI presents a striking example of single neuron control over a complex motor circuit.},

A multilayer neural network has several layers, including the input and output layer, and connections between the neighboring layers. It realizes a function from the input vector to the output vectorâ€”for example, multilayer perceptrons and the radial basis functions. The chapter explains that the statistical formulation of neural networks enables the introduction of a Riemannian metric on the neural network model. This Riemannian structure is essentially an intrinsic quantity of the statistical manifold, which is defined in the space of all the probabilities. The natural gradient is the direction that gives the steepest descent for a change of small, fixed length measured by the Riemannian metric. In introducing the natural gradient, the chapter emphasizes on the viewpoint that the metric of a parameter is not necessarily Euclidean but that a more natural metric can be introduced in many problems. In the case of parametric estimation, the Fisher information gives this. },

Here we analyze the detailed temporal evolution of glomerular activity patterns in the antennal lobe of honeybees. We represent these spatiotemporal patterns as trajectories in a multidimensional space, where each dimension accounts for the activity of one glomerulus. Our data show that the trajectories reach odor-specific steady states (attractors) that correspond to stable activity patterns at about 1 second after stimulus onset. As revealed by a detailed mathematical investigation, the trajectories are characterized by different phases: response onset, steady-state plateau, response offset, and periods of spontaneous activity. An analysis based on support-vector machines quantifies the odor specificity of the attractors and the optimal time needed for odor discrimination. The results support the hypothesis of a spatial olfactory code in the antennal lobe and suggest a perceptron-like readout mechanism that is biologically implemented in a downstream network, such as the mushroom body.},

To study the dynamics and temporal hierarchy of divisome assembly in Bacillus subtilis, we have examined the in vivo localization pattern of a set of division proteins fused to green fluorescent protein in germinating spores and vegetative cells. Using time series and time-lapse microscopy, we show that the FtsZ ring assembles early and concomitantly with FtsA, ZapA, and EzrA. After a time delay of at least 20\% of the cell cycle, a second set of division proteins, including GpsB, FtsL, DivIB, FtsW, Pbp2B, and DivIVA, are recruited to midcell. Together, our data provide in vivo evidence for two-step assembly of the divisome. Interestingly, overproduction of FtsZ advances the temporal assembly of EzrA but not of DivIVA, suggesting that a signal different from that of FtsZ polymerization drives the assembly of late divisome proteins. Microarray analysis shows that FtsZ depletion or overexpression does not significantly alter the transcription of division genes, supporting the hypothesis that cell division in B. subtilis is mainly regulated at the posttranscriptional level.},

  Abstract                 = {Gap junctions are known to be important for many network functions such as synchronization of activity and the generation of waves and oscillations. Gap junctions have also been proposed to be essential for the generation of early embryonic activity. We have previously shown that the amplitude of electrical signals propagating across gap-junctionally coupled passive cables is maximized at a unique diameter. This suggests that threshold-dependent signals may propagate through gap junctions for a finite range of diameters around this optimal value. Here we examine the diameter dependence of action potential propagation across model networks of dendro-dendritically coupled neurons. The neurons in these models have passive soma and dendrites and an action potential-generating axon. We show that propagation of action potentials across gap junctions occurs only over a finite range of dendritic diameters and that propagation delay depends on this diameter. Additionally, in networks of gap-junctionally coupled neurons, rhythmic activity can emerge when closed loops (re-entrant paths) occur but again only for a finite range of dendrite diameters. The frequency of such rhythmic activity depends on the length of the path and the dendrite diameter. For large networks of randomly coupled neurons, we find that the re-entrant paths that underlie rhythmic activity also depend on dendrite diameter. These results underline the potential importance of dendrite diameter as a determinant of network activity in gap-junctionally coupled networks, such as network rhythms that are observed during early nervous system development.},

It investigates the use of variants of this method to control the dynamics of a fibrillating sheep atrium in conjunction with a high-density mapping system to record the effects of the control perturbations on the entire atrium. This basic research program provides new insights into the fundamental mechanisms that regulate the dynamics of small pieces of cardiac muscle subjected to small, appropriately timed electrical stimuli.

  Abstract                 = {Increased caloric intake in dietary obesity could be driven by central mechanisms that regulate reward-seeking behavior. The mesolimbic dopamine system, and the nucleus accumbens in particular, underlies both food and drug reward. We investigated whether rat dietary obesity is linked to changes in dopaminergic neurotransmission in that region. Sprague–Dawley rats were placed on a cafeteria-style diet to induce obesity or a laboratory chow diet to maintain normal weight gain. Extracellular dopamine levels were measured by in vivo microdialysis. Electrically evoked dopamine release was measured ex vivo in coronal slices of the nucleus accumbens and the dorsal striatum using real-time carbon fiber amperometry. Over 15 weeks, cafeteria-diet fed rats became obese (&gt;20% increase in body weight) and exhibited lower extracellular accumbens dopamine levels than normal weight rats (0.007±0.001 vs. 0.023±0.002 pmol/sample; P&lt;0.05). Dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens of obese rats was stimulated by a cafeteria-diet challenge, but it remained unresponsive to a laboratory chow meal. Administration of d-amphetamine (1.5 mg/kg i.p.) also revealed an attenuated dopamine response in obese rats. Experiments measuring electrically evoked dopamine signal ex vivo in nucleus accumbens slices showed a much weaker response in obese animals (12 vs. 25×106 dopamine molecules per stimulation, P&lt;0.05). The results demonstrate that deficits in mesolimbic dopamine neurotransmission are linked to dietary obesity. Depressed dopamine release may lead obese animals to compensate by eating palatable “comfort” food, a stimulus that released dopamine when laboratory chow failed. },

The problem of spatial structure is studied for a multicompartmental integrate-and-fire model with a passive dendritic tree and active currents at the soma. In this case, the model dynamics can be solved and systematically reduced to a single-variable model with response kernels. The chapter reviews the standard Hodgkinâ€“Huxley model. The four differential equations of Hodgkin and Huxley give an accurate description of neuronal spiking in the giant axon of the squid. The chapter proposes a method based on spike response kernels and provides a biologically transparent description of the essential effects during spiking. The chapter discusses the spike response model (SRM), derived from the Hodgkinâ€“Huxley model by the SRM, can reproduce up to 90% of the spike times of the Hodkginâ€“Huxley model correctly. },

  Abstract                 = {Swimming behavior in the marine mollusc Tritonia diomedea is episodic, consisting of a series of alternating dorsal and ventral flexions initiated by a brief sensory stimulus. The swim motor pattern is generated by a network formed of four groups of premotor interneurons: cerebral cell 2 (C2), dorsal swim interneurons (DSIs), and two types of ventral swim interneurons (VSI-A and VSI-B). The initiation and maintenance of swimming depends on the establishment of a long-lasting ramp depolarization in both the premotor, pattern-generating interneurons, and the motor neurons (i.e., flexion neurons). Voltage clamp was used to measure the membrane current responsible for the ramp depolarization. In all cell classes the current had two components: a tonic inward current, which decayed as the swim progressed, and phasic inward current waves, which provided the synaptic drive during each swim burst. The ramp current in the flexion neurons and in C2 was generated largely by activity within the interneuronal pattern-generating network (PGN). The ramp current could be mimicked by driving activity in the pattern-generating interneurons. In VSI-B, the tonic component of the ramp current was independent of activity within the PGN and appeared to be derived from the long-lasting effect of an extrinsic input. The phasic components of the ramp, however, were dependent on PGN activity. The phasic inward current waves were blocked when pattern generation was prevented. In addition, phasic inward currents similar to those occurring during swimming could be produced by driving the C2. The tonic component of the ramp current in a DSI was dependent both on extrinsic inputs and PGN activity. Extrinsic inputs appeared to control the first 10-15 s of the tonic current. At longer times, activity within the DSI population itself maintained the ramp current. When one DSI was driven in a quiescent preparation, all other DSIs were inhibited, yet the DSIs are known to be coupled by monosynaptic, reciprocal excitatory synapses. This effect could be explained by the action of an unidentified inhibitory interneuron (I-neuron), which was excited by DSIs and in turn inhibited all other DSIs. The DSIs were therefore coupled reciprocally by both monosynaptic excitation and polysynaptic inhibition. Activity in C2 switched the DSI-DSI interaction from inhibition to excitation by inhibiting the I-neuron.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

The chapter presents some general theoretical concepts that deal with the variance of some statistical estimators. The chapter provides a general probabilistic framework that can be used to understand how the activity of a population of neurons can be considered as encoding information about the world and the way that this information can be decoded into a theoretical interpretation under rather simplifying assumptions. The chapter explores how various neuronal properties, such as receptive field size or preferred movement direction, can be inferred from correlation studies between neuronal activity and perceptual or motor responses. The chapter discusses various models and algorithms, which have been proposed for the interpretation of neuronal population activity. It discusses the role of correlated activity between neurons and overlap of receptive fields on the interpretation of population activity and examines how algorithms to interpret neuronal activity can be implemented into neuronal connectivity. },

These stretching and squeezing mechanisms in phase space are described in the chapter in terms of topology. The chapter applies a probe to understand how the flow in the phase space appropriate for neurons with subthreshold oscillations is deformed under the deterministic equations of the model. The chapter shows that the mechanism involved is responsible for chaos in the Duffing oscillator and in the \{YAG\} laser. It reviews the basic Hodgkinâ€“Huxley model of electrical activity in a neuron and its modified version. This model describes nerve cells that fire without external inputs. The chapter describes the behavior of the output of this model and the classification of low-dimensional strange attractors by topological means. It outlines the topological analysis program to the analysis of the strange attractors generated by the modified Hodgkinâ€“Huxley equations. },

  Abstract                 = {This article reports the use of commercial, flexible printed circuit technology for the fabrication of low-cost microelectrode arrays (MEAs) for recording extracellular electrical signals from cardiomyocyte cultures. A 36-electrode array has been designed and manufactured using standard, two-layer, polyimide-based flexible circuit technology, with electrode diameters of 75 and 100 μm. Copper structures defined on the backside of the array have been used for low-power thermal regulation of the culture. Electrical characterization of the gold-plated electrodes showed impedances below 250 kΩ at 1 kHz. Functional testing was conducted using HL-1 cardiac myocytes. The arrays proved biocompatible, and supported the formation of functional syncytia, as demonstrated by electrical recordings of depolarization waves across the array. A comparison with conventional, glass-based \{MEAs\} is presented, which reveals differences in signal strength (smaller for larger electrode) and variability (less for larger electrodes), but no effect of the substrate types on culture parameters such as beat rate or conduction velocity. The performance of the on-chip heating was evaluated, with typical temperature settling times (to ±0.1 °C) below 10 s, for a power consumption around 1 W (at 37 °C). Accuracy and stability are discussed. HL-1 cell responses to various temperature profiles enabled by the on-chip heating are presented, showing a remarkable correlation between temperature and beat rate. },

  Abstract                 = {The electrical characteristics of many neurons are remarkably robust in the face of changing internal and external conditions. At the same time, neurons can be highly sensitive to neuromodulators. We find correlates of this dual robustness and sensitivity in a global analysis of the structure of a conductance-based model neuron. We vary the maximal conductance parameters of the model neuron and, for each set of parameters tested, characterize the activity pattern generated by the cell as silent, tonically firing, or bursting. Within the parameter space of the five maximal conductances of the model, we find directions, representing concerted changes in multiple conductances, along which the basic pattern of neural activity does not change. In other directions, relatively small concurrent changes in a few conductances can induce transitions between these activity patterns. The global structure of the conductance-space maps implies that neuromodulators that alter a sensitive set of conductances will have powerful, and possibly state-dependent, effects. Other modulators that may have no direct impact on the activity of the neuron may nevertheless change the effects of such direct modulators via this state dependence. Some of the results and predictions arising from the model studies are replicated and verified in recordings of stomatogastric ganglion neurons using the dynamic clamp.},

In the networks investigated in the chapter, the neurons are connected in a random way, two neurons being connected with a probability that is constant across the network. They can be thought of as a model for a local cortical circuitâ€”for example, a functional cortical column in a sensory area. The chapter reviews some of the recent experimental results concerning patterns of synchrony in the central nervous system. It introduces the neuronal network models and shows how dynamical states of a large network can be classified either as asynchronous or synchronous. The chapter also shows how numerical simulations of a computational model of this structure can help to understand the mechanisms underlying spindle oscillations. },

Instead, we suggest that it reflects a natural variability that may be related to an underlying process of plasticity. First, we found that there is no fixed ratio among the three K+ currents. Second, we found that several hours of stimulation with depolarizing current pulses (0.5 sec duration at 1 Hz) altered the current density of the Ca2+-dependent outward current, IK(Ca), and the transient outward current, IA. This stimulation paradigm mimics the normal pattern of activity for these neurons. The effect of stimulation on the IA current density was eliminated when Ca2+ influx was blocked by extracellular Cd2+. In contrast, the K+ current densities of the lateral pyloric (LP) neuron were unaffected by the same pattern of stimulation, and the currents expressed by both the IC and the LP neurons were insensitive to hyperpolarizing pulses at the same frequency. We conclude that the conductance densities expressed by neurons may vary continually depending on the recent history of electrical activity in the preparation, and that intracellular Ca2+ may play a role in the processes by which activity influences the regulation of current densities in neurons.},

  Abstract                 = {Activity-dependent plasticity appears to play an important role in the modification of neurons and neural circuits that occurs during development and learning. Plasticity is also essential for the maintenance of stable patterns of activity in the face of variable environmental and internal conditions. Previous theoretical and experimental results suggest that neurons stabilize their activity by altering the number or characteristics of ion channels to regulate their intrinsic electrical properties. We present both experimental and modeling evidence to show that activity-dependent regulation of conductances, operating at the level of individual neurons, can also stabilize network activity. These results indicate that the stomatogastric ganglion of the crab can generate a characteristic rhythmic pattern of activity in two fundamentally different modes of operation. In one mode, the rhythm is strictly conditional on the presence of neuromodulatory afferents from adjacent ganglia. In the other, it is independent of neuromodulatory input but relies on newly developed intrinsic properties of the component neurons.},

  Abstract                 = {Parameters for models of biological systems are often obtained by averaging over experimental results from a number of different preparations. To explore the validity of this procedure, we studied the behavior of a conductance-based model neuron with five voltage-dependent conductances. We randomly varied the maximal conductance of each of the active currents in the model and identified sets of maximal conductances that generate bursting neurons that fire a single action potential at the peak of a slow membrane potential depolarization. A model constructed using the means of the maximal conductances of this population is not itself a one-spike burster, but rather fires three action potentials per burst. Averaging fails because the maximal conductances of the population of one-spike bursters lie in a highly concave region of parameter space that does not contain its mean. This demonstrates that averages over multiple samples can fail to characterize a system whose behavior depends on interactions involving a number of highly variable components.},

The behavior of the mathematical model for the lateral pyloric (LP) neuron of the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion (STG) developed in the previous paper was further studied. 2. The action of proctolin, a neuromodulatory peptide that acts directly on the LP neuron, was modeled. The effect of the proctolin-activated current (iproc) on the model neuron mimics the effects of proctolin on the isolated biological LP neuron. The depolarization and increased frequency of firing seen when iproc is activated are associated with changes in the relative contributions of the delayed rectifier (id) and the Ca(2+)-activated outward current (io(Ca] to the repolarization phase of the action potential. 3. The effects of turning off the A-current (iA) in the model were compared with those obtained by pharmacologically blocking iA in the biological neuron. iA appears to regulate action-potential frequency as well as postinhibitory rebound activity. 4. The role of iA on the rhythmic activity of the cell was studied by modifying several of its parameters while periodically activating a simulated synaptically activated conductance, isyn. 5. The effects of manipulations of the maximal conductances (g) for id and io(Ca) were studied. id strongly influences action-potential frequency, whereas io(Ca) strongly influences action-potential duration. 6. Modifications of the maximal conductance of the inward Ca2+ current (iCa) were compared with the effects of blocking iCa in the real cell. 7. The role of the hyperpolarization-activated inward current (ih) during ongoing rhythmic activity was assessed by periodically activating isyn while modifying ih.

  Abstract                 = {Background: Fluorescence detection of cell membrane potentials is an important technique in neurobiology, cell physiology and pharmaceutical screening, but traditional one-fluorophore indicators either respond too slowly or have limited sensitivity. Recently, we introduced two-component sensors based on the transfer of fluorescence resonance energy from fluorescent lectins bound on one side of the plasma membrane to highly fluorescent oxonol acceptors that electrophorese from one face of the membrane to the other in response to membrane potential. Results: We have found that fluorescent lectins can often be advantageously replaced in such sensors by fluorescently labeled phospholipids. A coumarin-labeled phosphatidylethanolamine donor and a bis(1,3-dihexyl-2-thiobarbiturate)trimethineoxonol acceptor gave the largest sensitivity of fluorescence ratio (&gt; 50% per 100 mV) ever reported. The response was also speeded several-fold by lengthening the mobile dye to the pentamethineoxonol analog, the &lt; 0.4 ms time constant of which was shorter than action potential durations. Photodynamic damage due to singlet oxygen was reduced by administering a natural carotenoid, astaxanthin. Conclusions: Voltage-sensitive fluorescence resonance energy transfer already gives record-setting performance on single cells and will continue to be rationally improvable. },

These systems include the ventral hippocampus, which is involved in context and focus on tasks, the amygdala, which mediates emotional behavior, and the prefrontal cortex, which modulates activity throughout the limbic system to enable behavioral flexibility. Each of these systems has overlapping projections to the nucleus accumbens, where these inputs are integrated under the modulatory influence of dopamine. Here, we provide a systems-oriented approach to interpreting the function of the dopamine system, its modulation of limbic–cortical interactions and how disruptions within this system might underlie the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and drug abuse. },

In addition to providing insight into DBS mechanisms, these results demonstrate an optical approach for dissection of disease circuitry and define the technological toolbox needed for systematic deconstruction of disease circuits by selectively controlling individual components.},

Fast-acting neurotransmitters, e.g., glutamate (excitatory) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (inhibitory), achieve effects on their target cells within one millisecond by virtue of opening ligand-operated ion channels. In contrast, all of the effects of the biogenic amine and peptide neurotransmitters, as well as many of the effects of glutamate and GABA, are achieved over hundreds of milliseconds to minutes by slow synaptic transmission. This latter process is mediated through an enormously more complicated sequence of biochemical steps, involving second messengers, protein kinases, and protein phosphatases. Slow-acting neurotransmitters control the efficacy of fast synaptic transmission by regulating the efficiency of neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminals and by regulating the efficiency with which fast-acting neurotransmitters produce their effects on postsynaptic receptors.},

These are circuits that can be called into action for perceptual, conceptual, and motor tasks, and we now need to understand whether there are coherent and overriding principles that govern the design and function of these modules. The discovery of central motor programs has provided crucial insight into the logic of one prototypic set of neural circuits: those that generate motor patterns. In this review, I discuss the mode of operation of these pattern generator networks and consider the neural mechanisms through which they are selected and activated. In addition, I will outline the utility of computational models in analysis of the dynamic actions of these motor networks.},

  Abstract                 = {The anterior burster (AB) neuron of the lobster stomatogastric ganglion displays varied rhythmic behavior when treated with neuromodulators and channel-blocking toxins. We introduce a channel-based model for this neuron and show how bifurcation analysis can be used to investigate the response of this model to changes of its parameters. Two dimensional maps of the parameter space of the model were constructed using computational tools based on the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems. Changes in the intrinsic firing and oscillatory properties of the model AB neuron were correlated with the boundaries of Hopf and saddle-node bifurcations on these maps. Complex rhythmic patterns were observed, with a bounded region of the parameter plane producing bursting behavior of the model neuron. Experiments were performed by treating an isolated AB cell with 4-aminopyridine which selectively reduces gA, the conductance of the transient potassium channel. The model accurately predicts the qualitative changes in the neuronal voltage oscillations that are observed over a range of reduction of gA in the neuron. These results demonstrate the efficacy of dynamical systems theory as a means of determining the varied oscillatory behaviors inherent in a channel-based neural model. Further, the maps of bifurcations provide a useful tool for determining how these behaviors depend upon model parameters and comparing the model to a real neuron.},

His seminal work supported by subsequent evidence generated largely from the 1960s onwards showed that across species walking, flying, and swimming are controlled largely by a neuronal network that has been referred to as the central pattern generator (CPG) for locomotion. In mammals, this caudally localized spinal cord network was found to generate the basic command signals sent to muscles of the limbs for locomotor rhythm and pattern generation.

  Abstract                 = {The stomatogastric ganglion (STG) is an excellent model for studying cellular and network interactions because it contains a relatively small number of cells (approximately 25 in C. borealis) which are well characterized. The cells in the STG exhibit a broad range of outputs and are responsible for the motor actions of the stomach. The stomach contains the gastric mill which breaks down food with three internal teeth, and the pylorus which filters the food before it reaches the midgut. The STG produces two rhythmic outputs to control the gastric mill and pylorus known as central pattern generators (CPGs). Each cell in the STG can participate in one or both of these rhythms. These CPGs allow for the study of neuromodulation, homeostasis, cellular and network variability, network development, and network recovery. The dissection of the stomatogastric nervous system (STNS) from the Jonah crab (Cancer borealis) is done in two parts; the gross and fine dissection. In the gross dissection the entire stomach is dissected from the crab. During the fine dissection the STNS is extracted from the stomach using a dissection microscope and micro-dissection tools (see figure 1). The STNS includes the STG, the oesophageal ganglion (OG), and the commissural ganglia (CoG) as well as the nerves that innervate the stomach muscles. Here, we show how to perform a complete dissection of the STNS in preparation for an electrophysiology experiment where the cells in the STG would be recorded from intracellularly and the peripheral nerves would be used for extracellular recordings. The proper technique for finding the desired nerves is shown as well as our technique of desheathing the ganglion to reveal the somata and neuropil.},

In vivo imaging showed morphologies, dendritic arbor dynamics, and growth rates characteristic of healthy cells. Coelectroporation of two plasmids resulted in expression of both proteins, while electroporation of fluorescent dextrans allowed direct visualization of transfer of molecules into cells.

Glutamatergic neurons have been implicated as being important for intrinsic rhythm generation in the CPG and for the command signal for initiating locomotion, although this has not been demonstrated directly. We used a newly generated vesicular glutamate transporter 2-channelrhodopsin2-yellow fluorescent protein (Vglut2-ChR2-YFP) mouse to directly examine the functional role of glutamatergic neurons in rhythm generation and initiation of locomotion. This mouse line expressed ChR2-YFP in the spinal cord and hindbrain. ChR2-YFP was reliably expressed in Vglut2-positive cells and YFP-expressing cells could be activated by light. Photo-stimulation of either the lumbar spinal cord or the caudal hindbrain was sufficient to both initiate and maintain locomotor-like activity. Our results indicate that glutamatergic neurons in the spinal cord are critical for initiating or maintaining the rhythm and that activation of hindbrain areas containing the locomotor command regions is sufficient to directly activate the spinal locomotor network.},

  Abstract                 = {Defining the attributes of individual central pattern-generating (CPG) neurons underlying various rhythmic behaviors are fundamental to our understanding of how the brain controls motor programs, such as respiration and locomotion. To this end, we have explored a simple invertebrate preparation in which the neuronal basis of respiratory rhythmogenesis can be investigated from the whole animal to a single cell level. An identified dopaminergic neuron, termed right pedal dorsal 1 (RPeD1), is a component of the CPG network which controls hypoxia-driven, aerial respiration in the fresh water snail Lymnaea stagnalis. Using intact, semi-intact and isolated brain preparations, we have discovered that in addition to its role as a respiratory CPG neuron, RPeD1 co-ordinates sensory-motor input from the pneumostome (the respiratory orifice) at the water/air interface to initiate respiratory rhythm generation. An additional, novel role of RPeD1 was also found. Specifically, direct intracellular stimulation of RPeD1 induced pneumostome openings, in the absence of motor neuronal activity. To determine further the role of RPeD1 in the respiratory behavior of intact animals, either its axon was severed or the soma selectively killed. Many components of the respiratory behavior in the intact animals were found to be perturbed following RPeD1 axotomy or ‘somatomy’ (soma removed). Taken together, the data presented provide a direct demonstration that RPeD1 is a multifunctional CPG neuron, which also serves many additional roles in the control of breathing behavior, ranging from co-ordination of mechanosensory input to the motor control of the respiratory orifice.},

  Abstract                 = {Oscillating neuronal circuits, known as central pattern generators (CPGs), are responsible for generating rhythmic behaviours such as walking, breathing and chewing. The CPG model alone however does not account for the ability of animals to adapt their future behaviour to changes in the sensory environment that signal reward. Here, using multi- electrode array (MEA) recording in an established experimental model of centrally generated rhythmic behaviour we show that the feeding CPG of Lymnaea stagnalis is itself associated with another, and hitherto unidentified, oscillating neuronal population. This extra-CPG oscillator is characterised by high population-wide activity alternating with population-wide quiescence. During the quiescent periods the CPG is refractory to activation by food-associated stimuli. Furthermore, the duration of the refractory period predicts the timing of the next activation of the CPG, which may be minutes into the future. Rewarding food stimuli and dopamine accelerate the frequency of the extra-CPG oscillator and reduce the duration of its quiescent periods. These findings indicate that dopamine adapts future feeding behaviour to the availability of food by significantly reducing the refractory period of the brain’s feeding circuitry.},

Modulatory inputs are essential components of \{CPG\} function: neuromodulators set the parameters of \{CPG\} neurons and synapses to render the networks functional. Each modulator acts on the network by many effects which may oppose one another; this may serve to stabilize the modulated state. Neuromodulators also determine the active neuronal composition in the CPG, which varies with state changes such as locomotor speed. The pattern of gene expression which determines the electrophysiological personality of each \{CPG\} neuron is also under modulatory control. It is not possible to model the function of neural networks without including the actions of neuromodulators. },

  Abstract                 = {Bath application of dopamine modifies the rhythmic motor pattern generated by the 14 neuron pyloric network in the stomatogastric ganglion of the spiny lobster, Panulirus interruptus. Among other effects, dopamine excites many of the pyloric constrictor (PY) neurons to fire at high frequency and phase-advances the timing of their activity in the motor pattern. These responses arise in part from direct actions of dopamine to modulate the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of the PY cells, and can be studied in synaptically isolated neurons. The rate of rebound following a hyperpolarizing prestep and the spike frequency during a subsequent depolarization are both accelerated by dopamine. Based on theoretical simulations, Hartline (1979) suggested that the rate of postinhibitory rebound in stomatogastric neurons could vary with the amount of voltage- sensitive transient potassium current (IA). Consistent with this prediction, we found that dopamine evokes a net conductance decrease in synaptically isolated PY neurons. In voltage clamp, dopamine reduces IA, specifically by reducing the amplitude of the slowly inactivating component of the current and shifting its voltage activation curve in the depolarized direction. 4-Aminopyridine, a selective blocker of IA in stomatogastric neurons, mimics and occludes the effects of dopamine on isolated PY neurons. A conductance-based mathematical model of the PY neuron shows appropriate changes in activity upon quantitative modification of the IA parameters affected by dopamine. These results demonstrate that dopamine excites and phase-advances the PY neurons in the rhythmic pyloric motor pattern at least in part by reducing the transient K+ current, IA.},

  Abstract                 = {Injection of the monoamines octopamine and serotonin into the hemolymph of lobsters causes them to assume opposing static postures: octopamine causes a tonic extension of all extremities, while serotonin induces a tonic flexion. These amines have been shown previously to act as circulating neurohormones and to cause contraction of isolated exoskeletal muscles. The opposing postures elicited by amine injection do not appear to arise from peripheral actions, however, since serotonin and octopamine have similar effects on both flexor and extensor muscles. Instead, the amines are present within the central nervous system where they are probably released synaptically to activate coordinated patterns of tonic motor activity generating the observed postures. These motor patterns have been recorded from abdominal ganglia and involve the synchronized activation and inhibition of multiple excitatory and inhibitory motoneurons innervating the postural flexor and extensor muscles. These effects can be observed in an isolated abdominal ganglion. To begin a search for the cellular targets of amine action within the central nervous system, we recorded from identified postural motoneurons in abdominal ganglia. In two motoneurons that act to produce postural extension, octopamine reduced and serotinin raised the apparent threshold for action potential generation recorded in the somata. The amines do not significantly affect the resting potential or input resistance of the motoneurons measured in the cell bodies.},

  Abstract                 = {It is now clear that neuromodulators can reconfigure a single motor net- work to allow the generation of a family of related movements. Using dopamine mod- ulation of the 14-neuron pyloric network from the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion as an example, we describe two major mechanisms by which network out- put is modulated. First, the baseline electrophysiological properties of the network neurons can be altered. Dopamine can affect the activity of each neuron indepen- dently. For example, DA modulates I A in nearly every neuron in the pyloric network, but in opposite directions in different cells. Furthermore, DA usually modulates com- binations of ionic currents. In some cases, currents with opposing actions on cell excitability are simultaneously affected, and the net response reflects the sum of these opposing effects. Second, neuromodulators can alter the strength of synaptic interac- tions within the network, quantitatively â??rewiringâ?? the network. Every synapse in the network is affected by DA, with some increased and others decreased in strength. DA acts both pre- and postsynaptically to affect transmission: these actions are fre- quently opposing in sign, and the net response arises as the sum of these opposing actions. Finally, spike-evoked and graded transmission at the same synapse can be oppositely affected by DA. These results emphasize the distributed nature of modu- lation in motor networks.},

The active pacemaker model simulates the kinetics of processes such as active response generation and electrogenic sodium pumping which govern the membrane potential trajectory between a reset-point following an impulse and threshold for the next impulse. Responses of the crayfish stretch receptor neuron (MRO) and of both models were studied for both abrupt steps and square pulses of current, both hyperpolarizing and depolarizing, as a function of phase of the start of the stimulus in the normal interspike interval. Physiological results are consistent with a substantially weaker effect of a perturbation delivered earlier in the interspike interval as compared to the same one given later. The active pacemaker model successfully simulates several of the prominent results of the physiology (though by no means all), while the linear integrate-and-fire model is less successful. },

Acitivity patterns arising from the thirty cells of the stomatogastric ganglion of Panulirus argus are described for both a semi-intact preparation and an isolated one. 2. The thirty or so cells can be divided so far into two functional groupings: the gastric mill group, with at least ten motor elements, and the pyloric group with at least fourteen. There is some, but not extensive, interaction between groups. 3. The main gastric mill activity is arranged in two sets of elements, each of which is composed of reciprocating elements innervating antagonistic muscles. Thus alternation in activity between the single LC and the two LG neurones results in alternate closing and opening of the lateral teeth; alternation between the four GM and single CP units results in alternate protraction and retraction of the medial tooth. 4. The two sets are phased to each other in such a way that they cause gastric mill teeth to operate effectively to masticate food. 5. The main pyloric activity is arranged in a three-part cycle with each of three sets of units active in sequence. Activity in two PD and one AB unit is followed by bursts in IC and LP units followed in turn by activity in up to seven PY units. Activity in a single VD neurone is locked to this cycle in a more complex pattern.},

  Abstract                 = {Neuronal release of modulatory substances provides motor pattern generating circuits with a high degree of flexibility. In vitro studies have characterized the actions of modulatory projection neurons in great detail in the stomatogastric nervous system, a model system for neuromodulatory influences on central pattern generators. Less is known about the activities and actions of modulatory neurons in fully functional and richly modulated network settings, i.e., in intact animals. It is also unknown whether their activities contribute to the motor patterns in different behavioral conditions. Here, we show for the first time the activity and effects of the well-characterized modulatory projection neuron 1 (MCN1) in vivo and compare them to in vitro conditions. MCN1 was always spontaneously active, typically in a rhythmic fashion with its firing being interrupted by ascending inhibitions from the pyloric motor circuit. Its activity contributed to pyloric motor activity, because 1) the cycle period of the motor pattern correlated with MCN1 firing frequency and 2) stimulating MCN1 shortened the cycle period while 3) lesioning of the MCN1 axon reduced motor activity. In addition, gastric mill motor activity was elicited for the duration of the stimulation. Chemosensory stimulation of the antennae moved MCN1 away from baseline activity by increasing its firing frequency. Following this increase, a gastric mill rhythm was elicited and the pyloric cycle period decreased. Lesioning the MCN1 axon prevented these effects. Thus modulatory projection neurons such as MCN1 can control the motor output in vivo, and they participate in the processing of exteroceptive sensory information in behaviorally relevant conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {Sensorimotor integration is known to occur at the level of motor circuits as well as in upstream interneurons that regulate motor activity. Here we show, using the crab stomatogastric nervous system (STNS) as a model, that different sensory systems affect the same set of projection neurons. However, they have qualitatively different effects on their activities (excitation vs. inhibition), and these differences contribute to the selection of motor patterns from multifunctional circuits. We compare the actions of the proprioceptive anterior gastric receptor (AGR) and the inferior ventricular (IV) neurons, which relay chemosensory information from the brain to the STNS, on modulatory commissural neurons 1 and 5 (MCN1 and MCN5) and commissural projection neuron 2 (CPN2) and their resulting actions on the gastric mill central pattern generating circuit in the stomatogastric ganglion. When stimulated, AGR and the IV neurons affect all three projection neurons but elicit distinct gastric mill rhythms. The effects of both sensory pathways on the projection neurons differ in the type of excitation provided to CPN2 and MCN5 (electrical vs. chemical) and the effect on MCN1 (direct inhibition by AGR vs. polysynaptic excitation by the IV neurons). The latter is functionally important because a restoration of MCN1 activity during the AGR rhythm made it more similar to that elicited by IV neuron stimulation. Our results thus support the hypothesis that sensory pathways activate different combinations of projection neurons to select distinct outputs from the same neuronal circuit.},

  Abstract                 = {1. The gastric central pattern generator (CPG) driving the three teeth of the gastric mill inside the lobster stomach has often been used as a model for the study of central nervous systems, but the actual functioning of the mill has never been observed directly. By using a small endoscope inserted through the esophagus a video analysis of the tooth movements was performed with restrained, but otherwise intact lobsters. 2. The teeth show spontaneous periodic chewing (cycle duration from 4 to 70 s) in two different basic modes. In the squeeze mode only the cusps of the three teeth move together simultaneously. In the cut-and-grind mode the lateral teeth close first with not only their cusps, but also their serrated edges. After this cut phase the lateral teeth grind backward along the file of the medial tooth, which simultaneously moves forward. 3. Simultaneous endoscope recordings of the teeth, filming of stomach muscles and ossicles combined with electrical stimulation of selected muscles reveal that muscle gm3c is responsible for this hitherto unknown backward grinding of the lateral teeth. 4. The complete behavioral repertoire includes the following modifications of the two basic modes. 1) The lateral teeth can perform chewing movements while the medial tooth stays still and vice versa, forms of chewing regarded even weaker than the squeeze. 2) There do not appear to be intermediates between the squeeze and cut-and-grind movements, with the latter as the strongest form of chewing. Transitions only occur as switching on a cycle-by-cycle basis. 3) A gradual change of the cut-and-grind chewing was observed as the gradual development of an additional opening over the time course of several periods. 4) After their grind phase, the lateral teeth can even move further back beyond the medial tooth. This can serve to push food into the pyloric filter apparatus. 5. Inflation of the cardiac sac can elicit single bites in a resting gastric mill. 6. The behavioral repertoire is compared with the in vivo activity of the gastric oscillator represented by simultaneous intracellular recording from 7 representative cells of the 11 CPG neurons.},

  Abstract                 = {1. The response of the isolated gastric central pattern generator (CPG) to bath application of proctolin is characterized and compared with the previously analyzed behavioral response. 2. Proctolin had an excitatory effect on the ongoing spontaneous rhythm of "combined" preparations, in which the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) is connected to the esophageal and commissural ganglia by the stomatogastric nerve (STN). The effect started between 20 s and 5 min and was characterized by strongly increased burst durations as well as increased spike rates in all units except the two lateral posterior gastric (LPG) motoneurons. The effect was strongest in the dorsal gastric (DG) and lateral gastric (LG) motoneurons and was accompanied by a phase change of the DG burst. DG continued spiking throughout large parts of the burst of LG and of the gastric mill (GM) motoneurons, which are antagonists of DG. 3. The threshold concentration was approximately 10(-10) M, and the effects were dose dependent and reversible. 4. LG and DG were identified as target cells for the action of proctolin. In LG regenerative plateau properties were induced, as revealed by its long-lasting plateau potentials, sensitivity for triggering inputs, and the occurrence of oscillatory prepotentials. An induction of endogenous bursting in DG was concluded from preparations, in which DG was cycling alone or bursting with a much shorter period duration than other gastric neurons. Hyperpolarization of DG, which normally has no or weak driving power within the gastric network, demonstrated that under the influence of proctolin, firing of DG can accelerate the gastric rhythm from a 27- to a 9-s period duration. 5. Proctolin does not only have a modulatory influence on an ongoing rhythm, but it also can trigger gastric activity. This function was first concluded from proctolin-treated STGs, which, unlike normal preparations, continue bursting if inputs via the STN are blocked. Finally, triggering was demonstrated directly, since isolated STGs that were not oscillating started a gastric rhythm after 20-30 min of perfusion with proctolin. 6. The proctolin-induced changes of the CPG activity in isolated preparations are in agreement with the effect on gastric mill chewing in the intact animal, in which, depending on the dose, different modes of chewing could be elicited.},

  Abstract                 = {Simultaneous endoscopic and electrophysiological recordings were used to observe the behavior of the gastric mill complex while recording the motor output of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) in intact crabs. In the crab STG, many pattern-generating neurons are able to fire in several distinct rhythmic motor patterns. Specifically, many neurons can switch between firing in time with the rapid pyloric rhythm to firing in time with the slower gastric mill rhythm (Weimann et al., 1991). We now correlate behaviorally relevant movements of the gastric mill with some of the modifications of neuronal firing patterns previously characterized using in vitro STG preparations. The intracellular and extracellular recordings from the intact crab are largely indistinguishable from those obtained from in vitro preparations. For the first time, we describe the movements that result as neurons switch their activity patterns associated with activation of the gastric mill rhythm. Extracellular stimulation and intracellular depolarization of individual motor neurons is used to determine the relationship between frequency of firing and movement in behaving animals.},

  Abstract                 = {Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the theory of synaptic plasticity. The chapter presents the theory of information storage, ranging from simple activity patterns of formal neurons to long-term processes involving spatiotemporal patterns of realistic neurons, and provides the argument with a detailed account of short-term plasticity. Despite being of short duration, short-term synaptic plasticity has profound effects on network behavior and is closely correlated with it. The chapter deals with the problem and analyzes a simple model of short-term plasticityâ€”that is, an adaptation of the model of Tsodyks and Markram to the SRM. The chapter specifies how the synaptic efficacies change as a function of presynaptic input- and time. The resulting setup allows a full-blown study of network behavior. As single synapses behave erratically, an ensemble of them provides a neuron with a practically deterministic input because of the strong law of large numbers, a mainstay of stochastic analysis. The ensemble of synapses decides whether the postsynaptic neuron will generate an action potential and, subsequently, a backpropagating spike. As spike generation is highly nonlinear, the chapter introduces the notion of â€œPoisson neuronâ€� to linearize the dynamics of the ensemble of synaptic efficacies. },

  Abstract                 = {The human brain has often been viewed as outstanding among mammalian brains: the most cognitively able, the largest-than-expected from body size, endowed with an overdeveloped cerebral cortex that represents over 80% of brain mass, and purportedly containing 100 billion neurons and 10x more glial cells. Such uniqueness was seemingly necessary to justify the superior cognitive abilities of humans over larger-brained mammals such as elephants and whales. However, our recent studies using a novel method to determine the cellular composition of the brain of humans and other primates as well as of rodents and insectivores show that, since different cellular scaling rules apply to the brains within these orders, brain size can no longer be considered a proxy for the number of neurons in the brain. These studies also showed that the human brain is not exceptional in its cellular composition, as it was found to contain as many neuronal and nonneuronal cells as would be expected of a primate brain of its size. Additionally, the so-called overdeveloped human cerebral cortex holds only 19% of all brain neurons, a fraction that is similar to that found in other mammals. In what regards absolute numbers of neurons, however, the human brain does have two advantages compared to other mammalian brains: compared to rodents, and probably to whales and elephants as well, it is built according to the very economical, space-saving scaling rules that apply to other primates; and, among economically-built primate brains, it is the largest, hence containing the most neurons. These findings argue in favor of a view of cognitive abilities that is centered on absolute numbers of neurons, rather than on body size or encephalization, and call for a re-examination of several concepts related to the exceptionality of the human brain.},

The distinct advantage of this technique is that experimental manipulations may be performed on individual cells while leaving the surrounding tissue unaltered, thereby distinguishing cell-autonomous effects from those resulting from global treatments. When combined with advanced in vivo imaging techniques, SCE of fluorescent markers permits direct visualization of cellular morphology, cell growth, and intracellular events over timescales ranging from seconds to days. While this technique is used in a variety of in vivo and ex vivo preparations, we have optimized this technique for use in Xenopus laevis tadpoles. In this video article, we detail the procedure for SCE of a fluorescent dye or plasmid DNA into neurons within the intact brain of the albino Xenopus tadpole. We also discuss methods to optimize yield, and show examples of live two-photon fluorescence imaging of neurons fluorescently labeled by SCE.},

  Abstract                 = {We modeled a segmental oscillator of the timing network that paces the heartbeat of the leech. This model represents a network of six heart interneurons that comprise the basic rhythm-generating network within a single ganglion. This model builds on a previous two cell model (Nadim et al., 1995) by incorporating modifications of intrinsic and synaptic currents based on the results of a realistic waveform voltage-clamp study (Olsen and Calabrese, 1996). Due to these modifications, the new model behaves more similarly to the biological system than the previous model. For example, the slow-wave oscillation of membrane potential that underlies bursting is similar in form and amplitude to that of the biological system. Furthermore, the new model with its expanded architecture demonstrates how coordinating interneurons contribute to the oscillations within a single ganglion, in addition to their role of intersegmental coordination.

Do the members of motor networks change from moment-to-moment or from motor program episode-to-episode? These are questions that can only be addressed in systems where it is possible to monitor the spiking activity of networks of neurons during the production of motor programs. We used large-scale voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) imaging followed by Independent Component Analysis spike-sorting to examine the extent to which the neuronal network underlying the escape swim behavior of <italic>Tritonia diomedea</italic> is hard-wired versus fluid from a moment-to-moment perspective. We found that while most neurons were dedicated to the swim network, a small but significant proportion of neurons participated in a surprisingly variable manner. These neurons joined the swim motor program late, left early, burst only on some cycles or skipped cycles of the motor program. We confirmed that this variable neuronal participation was not due to effects of the VSD by finding such neurons with intracellular recording in dye-free saline. Further, these neurons markedly varied their level of participation in the network from swim episode-to-episode. The generality of such unreliably bursting neurons was confirmed by their presence in the rhythmic escape networks of two other molluscan species, <italic>Tritonia festiva</italic> and <italic>Aplysia californica</italic>. Our observations support a view that neuronal networks, even those underlying rhythmic and stereotyped motor programs, may be more variable in structure than widely appreciated.</p>},

  Abstract                 = {The importance of ionic movements in excitable tissues has been emphasized by a number of recent experiments. On the one hand, there is the finding that the nervous impulse is associated with an inflow of sodium and an outflow of potassiuim (e.g. Rothenberg, 1950; Keynes \& Lewis, 1951). On the other, there are experiments which show that the rate of rise and amplitude of the action potential are determined by the concentration of sodium in the external medium (e.g. Hodgkin \& Katz, 1949a; Huxley \& Stiimpffi, 1951). Both groups of experiments are consistent with the theory that nervous conduction depends on a specific increase in permeability which allows sodium ions to move from the more concentrated solution outside a nerve fibre to the more dilute solution inside it. This movement of charge makes the inside of the fibre positive and provides a satisfactory explanation for the rising phase of the spike. Repolarization during the falling phase probably depends on an outflow of potassium ions and may be accelerated by a process which increases the potassium permeability after the action potential has reached its crest (Hodgkin, Huxley \& Katz, 1949).}

  Abstract                 = {The modulation of the pyloric network of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the lobster Panulirus interruptus by the neuropeptide proctolin is described. First, the effects of proctolin on the pyloric motor patterns were characterized in terms of frequency and phase relations. Pyloric cycle frequency and lateral pyloric (LP) neuron activity increased and ventricular dilator (VD) neuron activity decreased with increasing concentrations (10(-9)-10(-6) M) of applied proctolin. Next, the effects of proctolin on the individual neurons that constitute the pyloric network were determined. Identified neurons were isolated from chemical and electrical presynaptic inputs by using pharmacological agents (Marder and Eisen, 1984a) and/or photoinactivation following Lucifer yellow injection (Miller and Selverston, 1979). Proctolin increased the amplitude and frequency of bursts produced by isolated pacemaker anterior burster (AB) neurons. Isolated LP and pyloric (PY) neurons responded to proctolin with increases in activity only when they were at or above threshold. All other pyloric neurons were unaffected. To determine how the direct effects of proctolin on isolated neurons resulted in the observed changes in frequency and phase relations in the motor pattern of the intact pyloric circuit seen in proctolin, individual neurons were deleted from the circuit. A comparison of proctolin's effects on isolated neurons with those on the intact network shows that the synaptic connectivity among neurons directly affected by proctolin and those unaffected by it shapes the network's response to proctolin.},

  Abstract                 = {Gap junctions consist of intercellular channels dedicated to providing a direct pathway for ionic and biochemical communication between contacting cells. After an initial burst of publications describing electrical coupling in the brain, gap junctions progressively became less fashionable among neurobiologists, as the consensus was that this form of synaptic transmission would play a minimal role in shaping neuronal activity in higher vertebrates. Several new findings over the last decade (e.g. the implication of connexins in genetic diseases of the nervous system, in processing sensory information and in synchronizing the activity of neuronal networks) have brought gap junctions back into the spotlight. The appearance of gap junctional coupling in the nervous system is developmentally regulated, restricted to distinct cell types and persists after the establishment of chemical synapses, thus suggesting that this form of cellâ€“cell signaling may be functionally interrelated with, rather than alternative to chemical transmission. This review focuses on gap junctions between neurons and summarizes the available data, derived from molecular, biological, electrophysiological, and genetic approaches, that are contributing to a new appreciation of their role in brain function. },

In 2005, optogenetic proteins were expressed in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans for the first time. Since then, C. elegans has served as a powerful platform upon which to conduct optogenetic investigations of synaptic function, circuit dynamics and the neuronal basis of behaviour. The C. elegans nervous system, consisting of 302 neurons, whose connectivity and morphology has been mapped completely, drives a rich repertoire of behaviours that are quantifiable by video microscopy. This model organism's compact nervous system, quantifiable behaviour, genetic tractability and optical accessibility make it especially amenable to optogenetic interrogation. Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), halorhodopsin (NpHR/Halo) and other common optogenetic proteins have all been expressed in C. elegans. Moreover, recent advances leveraging molecular genetics and patterned light illumination have now made it possible to target photoactivation and inhibition to single cells and to do so in worms as they behave freely. Here, we describe techniques and methods for optogenetic manipulation in C. elegans. We review recent work using optogenetics and C. elegans for neuroscience investigations at the level of synapses, circuits and behaviour.},

  Abstract                 = {A fundamental problem in neural network research, as well as in many other disciplines, is finding a suitable representation of multivariate data, i.e. random vectors. For reasons of computational and conceptual simplicity, the representation is often sought as a linear transformation of the original data. In other words, each component of the representation is a linear combination of the original variables. Well-known linear transformation methods include principal component analysis, factor analysis, and projection pursuit. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a recently developed method in which the goal is to find a linear representation of non-Gaussian data so that the components are statistically independent, or as independent as possible. Such a representation seems to capture the essential structure of the data in many applications, including feature extraction and signal separation. In this paper, we present the basic theory and applications of ICA, and our recent work on the subject.},

The review will first cover neurobiological observations concerning locomotor CPGs and their numerical modelling, with a special focus on vertebrates. It will then cover how CPG models implemented as neural networks or systems of coupled oscillators can be used in robotics for controlling the locomotion of articulated robots. The review also presents how robots can be used as scientific tools to obtain a better understanding of the functioning of biological CPGs. Finally, various methods for designing CPGs to control specific modes of locomotion will be briefly reviewed. In this process, I will discuss different types of CPG models, the pros and cons of using CPGs with robots, and the pros and cons of using robots as scientific tools. Open research topics both in biology and in robotics will also be discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {In order to model neuronal behavior or to interpret the results of modeling studies, neuroscientists must call upon methods of nonlinear dynamics. This book offers an introduction to nonlinear dynamical systems theory for researchers and graduate students in neuroscience. It also provides an overview of neuroscience for mathematicians who want to learn the basic facts of electrophysiology.

Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience presents a systematic study of the relationship of electrophysiology, nonlinear dynamics, and computational properties of neurons. It emphasizes that information processing in the brain depends not only on the electrophysiological properties of neurons but also on their dynamical properties. The book introduces dynamical systems, starting with one- and two-dimensional Hodgkin-Huxley-type models and continuing to a description of bursting systems. Each chapter proceeds from the simple to the complex, and provides sample problems at the end. The book explains all necessary mathematical concepts using geometrical intuition; it includes many figures and few equations, making it especially suitable for non-mathematicians. Each concept is presented in terms of both neuroscience and mathematics, providing a link between the two disciplines.

Nonlinear dynamical systems theory is at the core of computational neuroscience research, but it is not a standard part of the graduate neuroscience curriculum—or taught by math or physics department in a way that is suitable for students of biology. This book offers neuroscience students and researchers a comprehensive account of concepts and methods increasingly used in computational neuroscience.

  Abstract                 = {Objective: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder characterised by a large number of motor and non-motor features that can impact on function to a variable degree. This review describes the clinical characteristics of PD with emphasis on those features that differentiate the disease from other parkinsonian disorders.Methods: A MedLine search was performed to identify studies that assess the clinical characteristics of PD. Search terms included “Parkinson’s disease”, “diagnosis” and “signs and symptoms”.Results: Because there is no definitive test for the diagnosis of PD, the disease must be diagnosed based on clinical criteria. Rest tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and loss of postural reflexes are generally considered the cardinal signs of PD. The presence and specific presentation of these features are used to differentiate PD from related parkinsonian disorders. Other clinical features include secondary motor symptoms (eg, hypomimia, dysarthria, dysphagia, sialorrhoea, micrographia, shuffling gait, festination, freezing, dystonia, glabellar reflexes), non-motor symptoms (eg, autonomic dysfunction, cognitive/neurobehavioral abnormalities, sleep disorders and sensory abnormalities such as anosmia, paresthesias and pain). Absence of rest tremor, early occurrence of gait difficulty, postural instability, dementia, hallucinations, and the presence of dysautonomia, ophthalmoparesis, ataxia and other atypical features, coupled with poor or no response to levodopa, suggest diagnoses other than PD.Conclusions: A thorough understanding of the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations of PD is essential to the proper diagnosis of the disease. Genetic mutations or variants, neuroimaging abnormalities and other tests are potential biomarkers that may improve diagnosis and allow the identification of persons at risk.},

Mudd Hall, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853 (E-mail: BRJ1{at}Cornell.Edu). Submitted 5 January 2003.Accepted 26 March 2003.Abstract We examined the dopamine (DA) modulation of calcium currents (ICa) that could contribute to the plasticity of the pyloric network in the lobster stomatogastric ganglion. Pyloric somata were voltage-clamped under conditions designed to block voltage-gated Na+, K+, and H currents. Depolarizing steps from {\textendash}60 mV generated voltage-dependent, inward currents that appeared to originate in electrotonically distal, imperfectly clamped regions of the cell. These currents were blocked by Cd2+ and enhanced by Ba2+ but unaffected by Ni2+. Dopamine enhanced the peak ICa in the pyloric constrictor (PY), lateral pyloric (LP), and inferior cardiac (IC) neurons and reduced peak ICa in the ventricular dilator (VD), pyloric dilator (PD), and anterior burster (AB) neurons. All of these effects, except for the AB, are consistent with DA{\textquoteright}s excitation or inhibition of firing in the pyloric neurons. Enhancement of ICa in PY and LP neurons and reduction of ICa in VD and PD neurons are also consistent with DA-induced synaptic strength changes via modulation of presynaptic ICa. However, the reduction of ICa in AB suggests that DA{\textquoteright}s enhancement of AB transmitter release is not directly mediated through presynaptic ICa. ICa in PY and PD neurons was more sensitive to nifedipine block than in AB neurons. In addition, nifedipine blocked DA{\textquoteright}s effects on ICa in the PY and PD neurons but not in the AB neuron. Thus the contribution of specific calcium channel subtypes carrying the total ICa may vary between pyloric neuron classes, and DA may act on different calcium channel subtypes in the different pyloric neurons.

  Abstract                 = {The phasing of neuronal activity in a rhythmic motor network is determined by a neuron's intrinsic firing properties and synaptic inputs; these could vary in their relative importance under different modulatory conditions. In the lobster pyloric network, the firing of eight follower pyloric (PY) neurons is shaped by their intrinsic rebound after pacemaker inhibition and by synaptic input from the lateral pyloric (LP) neuron, which inhibits all PY neurons and is electrically coupled to a subset of them. Under control conditions, LP inhibition is weak and has little influence on PY firing. We examined modulation that could theoretically enhance the LP's synaptic contribution to PY firing. We measured the effects of dopamine (DA) on LP?PY synapses, driving the LP neuron with trains of realistic waveforms constructed from prerecorded control and DA LP oscillations, which differed in shape and duration. Under control conditions, chemical inhibition underwent severe depression and disappeared; in the mixed synapses, electrical coupling dominated. Switching between control and DA LP waveforms (with or without DA present) caused only subtle changes in synaptic transmission. DA markedly enhanced synaptic inhibition, reduced synaptic depression and weakened electrical coupling, reversing the sign of the mixed synapses. Despite this, removal of the LP from the intact network still had only weak effects on PY firing. DA also enhances PY intrinsic rebound properties, which still control the onset of PY firing. Thus in a rhythmic network, the functional importance of synaptic modulation can only be understood in the context of parallel modulation of intrinsic properties.},

T. Birmingham, L. F. Abbott, and Eve Marder. Temporal dynamics of convergent modulation at a crustacean neuromuscular junction. J. Neurophysiol. 80: 2559{\textendash}2570, 1998. At least 10 different substances modulate the amplitude of nerve-evoked contractions of the gastric mill 4 (gm4) muscle of the crab, Cancer borealis. Serotonin, dopamine, octopamine, proctolin, red pigment concentrating hormone, crustacean cardioactive peptide, TNRNFLRFamide, and SDRNFLRFamide increased and d-allatostatin-3 and histamine decreased the amplitude of nerve-evoked contractions. Modulator efficacy was frequency dependent; TNRNFLRFamide, proctolin, and dallatostatin-3 were more effective when the motor neuron was stimulated at 10 Hz than at 40 Hz, whereas the reverse was true for dopamine and serotonin. The modulators that were most effective at high stimulus frequencies produced a significant decrease in muscle relaxation time; those that were most effective at low stimulus frequencies produced modest increases in relaxation time. Thus modulator actions that appear redundant when examined only at one stimulus frequency are differentiated when a range of stimulus dynamics is studied. The effects of TNRNFLRFamide, serotonin, proctolin, dopamine, and d-allatostatin-3 on the amplitude and facilitation of nerve-evoked excitatory junctional potentials (EJPs) in the gm4 and gastric mill 6 (gm6) muscles were compared. The EJPs in gm4 have a large initial amplitude and show relatively little facilitation, whereas the EJPs in gm6 have a small initial amplitude and show considerable facilitation. Modulators that enhanced contractions also enhanced EJP amplitude; d-allatostatin-3 reduced EJP amplitude. The effects of these modulators on EJP amplitude were modest and showed no significant frequency dependence. This suggests that the frequency dependence of modulator action on contraction results from effects on excitation{\textendash}contraction coupling. The modulators affected facilitation at these junctions in a manner consistent with a change in release probability. They produced a change in facilitation that is inversely related to their action on EJP amplitude. Footnotes Address for reprint requests: E.

Calcium waves can be viewed as a fingerprint of the underlying complex physiological processes that create these waves and of its chemical environment. In other words, the intercellular calcium waves probe the ionic environment of the cell culture and their macroscopic features give clues about it. One of the remarkable features of the intercellular calcium waves is their large amount of â€œfuzziness.â€� This feature and their apparently random generation in cultures of rat hippocampal astrocytes motivate the second hypothesis that noise plays a role for the generation as well as the propagation of intercellular calcium waves. This difference can be quantified using the spaceâ€“time cluster decomposition method. The chapter performs the spaceâ€“time cluster analysis of calcium waves in cultures of astrocytes of rat brain and epileptic human tissue. },

  Abstract                 = {Publisher Summary This chapter provides a brief description of the behavior of the biological neuron and some properties of the synapses and discusses under which assumptions the description by a probabilistic binary threshold device is appropriate. It discusses stochastic neural networks with parallel and sequential dynamics. A Markov process gives this dynamics, and the chapter discusses some of the properties of Markov processes, such as ergodicity and periodicity. The chapter considers a form of mean field (MF) theory that does not involve the quenched average and derives \{MF\} approximations for the mean firing rates and the correlations for stochastic networks with arbitrary connectivity. A drawback of this approach is that it is only valid for small values of the weights. The chapter briefly discusses Hebbian learning in the attractor neural network and the Boltzmann machine. },

  Abstract                 = {For the mollusc Tritonia diomedea to generate its escape swim motor pattern, interneuron C2, a crucial member of the central pattern generator (CPG) for this rhythmic behavior, must fire repetitive bursts of action potentials. Yet, before swimming, repeated depolarizing current pulses injected into C2 at periods similar those in the swim motor program are incapable of mimicking the firing rate attained by C2 on each cycle of a swim motor program. This resting level of C2 inexcitability is attributable to its own inherent spike frequency adaptation (SFA). Clearly, this property must be altered for the swim behavior to occur. The pathway for initiation of the swimming behavior involves activation of the serotonergic dorsal swim interneurons (DSIs), which are also intrinsic members of the swim CPG. Physiologically appropriate DSI stimulation transiently decreases C2 SFA, allowing C2 to fire at higher rates even when repeatedly depolarized at short intervals. The increased C2 excitability caused by DSI stimulation is mimicked and occluded by serotonin application. Furthermore, the change in excitability is not caused by the depolarization associated with DSI stimulation or serotonin application but is correlated with a decrease in C2 spike afterhyperpolarization. This suggests that the DSIs use serotonin to evoke a neuromodulatory action on a conductance in C2 that regulates its firing rate. This modulatory action of one CPG neuron on another is likely to play a role in configuring the swim circuit into its rhythmic pattern-generating mode and maintaining it in that state.},

  Abstract                 = {1. Neuromodulation has previously been shown to be intrinsic to the central pattern generator (CPG) circuit that generates the escape swim of the nudibranch mollusk Tritonia diomedea; the dorsal swim interneurons (DSIs) make conventional monosynaptic connections and evoke neuromodulatory effects within the swim motor circuit. The conventional synaptic potentials evoked by a DSI onto cerebral neuron 2 (C2) and onto the dorsal flexion neurons (DFNs) consist of a fast excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) followed by a prolonged slow EPSP. In their neuromodulatory role, the DSIs produce an enhancement of the monosynaptic connections made by C2 onto other CPG circuit interneurons and onto efferent flexion neurons. Previous work showed that the DSIs are immunoreactive for serotonin. Here we provide evidence that both the neurotransmission and the neuromodulation evoked by the DSIs are produced by serotonin, and that these effects may be pharmacologically separable. 2. Previously it was shown that bath-applied serotonin both mimics and occludes the modulation of the C2 synapses by the DSIs. Here we find that pressure-applied puffs of serotonin mimic both the fast and slow EPSPs evoked by a DSI onto a DFN, whereas high concentrations of bath-applied serotonin occlude both of these synaptic components. 3. Consistent with the hypothesis that serotonin mediates the actions of the DSIs, the serotonin reuptake inhibitor imipramine prolongs the duration of the fast DSI-DFN EPSP, increases the amplitude of the slow DSI-DFN EPSP, and increases both the amplitude and duration of the modulation of the C2-DFN synapse by the DSIs. 4.Two serotonergic antagonists were found that block the actions of the DSIs. Gramine blocks the fast DSI-DFN EPSP, and has far less of an effect on the slow EPSP and the modulation. Gramine also diminishes the depolarization evoked by pressure-applied serotonin, showing that it is a serotonin antagonist in this system. In contrast, methysergide greatly reduces both the slow EPSP and the modulation evoked by the DSIs, but has mixed effects on the fast EPSP. Methysergide also blocks the ability of exogenous serotonin to enhance the C2-DFN EPSP, demonstrating that it antagonizes the serotonin receptors responsible for this modulation. 5. Taken together with previous work, these results indicate that serotonin is likely to be responsible for all three actions of the DSIs that were examined: the fast and slow DSI-DFN EPSPs and the neuromodulation of the C2-DFN synapse. These results also indicate that the conventional and neuromodulatory effects of the DSIs may be pharmacologically separable. In future work it may be possible to determine the functional role of each in the swim circuit.},

Mathematical models are used to examine the effect of electrically coupling an oscillatory neuron to a second neuron that is either silent or tonically firing. Models of oscillatory neurons with varying degrees of complexity show that this coupling can either increase or decrease the frequency of an oscillator, depending on its membrane potential wave form, the state of the neuron to which it is coupled, and the strength of the coupling. Thus, electrical coupling provides a flexible mechanism for modifying the behavior of an oscillatory neural network.},

  Abstract                 = {Measures of multiple spike train synchrony are essential in order to study issues such as spike timing reliability, network synchronization, and neuronal coding. These measures can broadly be divided in multivariate measures and averages over bivariate measures. One of the most recent bivariate approaches, the ISI-distance, employs the ratio of instantaneous interspike intervals (ISIs). In this study we propose two extensions of the ISI-distance, the straightforward averaged bivariate ISI-distance and the multivariate ISI-diversity based on the coefficient of variation. Like the original measure these extensions combine many properties desirable in applications to real data. In particular, they are parameter-free, time scale independent, and easy to visualize in a time-resolved manner, as we illustrate with in vitro recordings from a cortical neuron. Using a simulated network of Hindemarshâ€“Rose neurons as a controlled configuration we compare the performance of our methods in distinguishing different levels of multi-neuron spike train synchrony to the performance of six other previously published measures. We show and explain why the averaged bivariate measures perform better than the multivariate ones and why the multivariate ISI-diversity is the best performer among the multivariate methods. Finally, in a comparison against standard methods that rely on moving window estimates, we use single-unit monkey data to demonstrate the advantages of the instantaneous nature of our methods. },

One of the most recent methods is the ISI-distance which extracts information from the interspike intervals (ISIs) by evaluating the ratio of the instantaneous firing rates. In contrast to most previously proposed measures it is parameter free and time-scale independent. However, it is not well suited to track changes in synchrony that are based on spike coincidences. Here we propose the SPIKE-distance, a complementary measure which is sensitive to spike coincidences but still shares the fundamental advantages of the ISI-distance. In particular, it is easy to visualize in a time-resolved manner and can be extended to a method that is also applicable to larger sets of spike trains. We show the merit of the SPIKE-distance using both simulated and real data. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently, the SPIKE-distance has been proposed as a parameter-free and timescale-independent measure of spike train synchrony. This measure is time resolved since it relies on instantaneous estimates of spike train dissimilarity. However, its original definition led to spuriously high instantaneous values for eventlike firing patterns. Here we present a substantial improvement of this measure that eliminates this shortcoming. The reliability gained allows us to track changes in instantaneous clustering, i.e., time-localized patterns of (dis)similarity among multiple spike trains. Additional new features include selective and triggered temporal averaging as well as the instantaneous comparison of spike train groups. In a second step, a causal SPIKE-distance is defined such that the instantaneous values of dissimilarity rely on past information only so that time-resolved spike train synchrony can be estimated in real time. We demonstrate that these methods are capable of extracting valuable information from field data by monitoring the synchrony between neuronal spike trains during an epileptic seizure. Finally, the applicability of both the regular and the real-time SPIKE-distance to continuous data is illustrated on model electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings.},

The sensory and motor structures of the brain encode information in various different formats. Sensorimotor transformations interface the sensory and motor systems. They have two main tasks to solve. First, they must convert between the different coding formats. Second, they must fuse the different sensory and motor input signals and establish a unified representation of the environment and the organism's action within it. The fibers of the retinal ganglion cells form a thick parallel bundle, called the â€œoptic tract,â€� from which branches run to several parallel retinal recipient structures. The main cortical pathway is via the thalamus to the primary visual cortex, or area V1. Other important pathways are those to the superior colliculus and to the accessory optic system and pretectum. Each retinal ganglion cell transmits information from a small-localized part of the visual image, known as its â€œreceptive field.â€� The chapter discusses the position of the limbs and the activity of the muscles; this is known as â€œproprioceptive informationâ€� and is generated by spindle fibers in the muscles. },

  Abstract                 = {Summary The causes of Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, are still largely unknown. Current thinking is that major gene mutations cause only a small proportion of all cases and that in most cases, non-genetic factors play a part, probably in interaction with susceptibility genes. Numerous epidemiological studies have been done to identify such non-genetic risk factors, but most were small and methodologically limited. Larger, well-designed prospective cohort studies have only recently reached a stage at which they have enough incident patients and person-years of follow-up to investigate possible risk factors and their interactions. In this article, we review what is known about the prevalence, incidence, risk factors, and prognosis of \{PD\} from epidemiological studies. },

  Abstract                 = {We have studied the Ca2+ dynamics of burstingâ€“spiking neurons in the lobster stomatogastric ganglion. Neurons in this ganglion undergo spontaneous oscillations in membrane voltage with a period of 1â€“10 s in situ. We found that neurons isolated from the ganglion and filled with the fluorescent calcium indicator Fluo-4 show simultaneous changes of membrane potential and cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]I). These Ca2+ signals are highly heterogeneous both in terms of amplitude and time constants. They showed variable spatial distributions with the soma exhibiting low and slow signals, and a region in the process with large and fast signals. Ca2+ transients in the processes are dependent on external Ca2+ and can be blocked by Co2+, but not other, more specific Ca2+ current blockers. Rather, nifedipine a known Ca2+ current blocker, affects the distribution of the Ca2+ signal, which suggests a specific localization of Ca2+ channels. Although the signal is not absolutely dependent on action potentials, it is greatly reduced when action potentials are blocked by tetrodotoxin. Termination of the signal depends only slightly on Ca2+ buffering mechanisms such as mitochondria, Ca2+/Na+ and Ca2+/H+ exchangers. We also demonstrate the presence of caffeine-sensitive internal stores in stomatogastric ganglion cells. The store distribution is different but overlaps with the voltage-dependent distribution. The maximal caffeine-activated Ca2+ signal is in the soma and it is smaller in the processes. Unlike the voltage-activated Ca2+ signal this signal is not blocked by Co2+. Nevertheless, the two types of signal interact during caffeine application. This unique spatial separation of two Ca2+ sources may have important functional implication. },

  Abstract                 = {Membrane channels are subject to a wide variety of regulatory mechanisms that can be affected by activity. We present a model of a stomatogastric ganglion (STG) neuron in which several Ca2+-dependent pathways are used to regulate the maximal conductances of membrane currents in an activity-dependent manner. Unlike previous models of this type, the regulation and modification of maximal conductances by electrical activity is unconstrained. The model has seven voltage-dependent membrane currents and uses three Ca2+ sensors acting on different time scales. Starting from random initial conditions over a given range, the model sets the maximal conductances for its active membrane currents to values that produce a predefined target pattern of activity ?90% of the time. In these models, the same pattern of electrical activity can be produced by a range of maximal conductances, and this range is compared with voltage-clamp data from the lateral pyloric neuron of the STG. If the electrical activity of the model neuron is perturbed, the maximal conductances adjust to restore the original pattern of activity. When the perturbation is removed, the activity pattern is again restored after a transient adjustment period, but the conductances may not return to their initial values. The model suggests that neurons may regulate their conductances to maintain fixed patterns of electrical activity, rather than fixed maximal conductances, and that the regulation process requires feedback systems capable of reacting to changes of electrical activity on a number of different time scales.},

This technology is especially powerful for the study of patterns of activity in complex multicellular preparations. It also makes possible the measurement of spatial and temporal variations in membrane potential along the surface of single cells. The fast dyes which have been developed in this laboratory are in the structural class called styryl or naphthylstyryl. These are amphiphilic membrane staining dyes which usually have a pair of hydrocarbon chains acting as membrane anchors and a hydrophilic group which aligns the chromophore perpendicular to the membrandaqueous interface. The chromophore is believed to undergo a large electronic charge shift as a result of excitation from the ground to the excited state and this underlies the putative electrochromic mechanism for the sensitivity of these dyes to membrane potential. We have used these dyes to map the membrane potential along the surface of single cells with high resolution digital imaging microscopy techniques. These compounds also display remarkable efficiencies for second harmonic generation. Further, the second harmonic signal can be generated from a dye-stained membrane and is modulatable by changing the membrane voltage.},

However, the rhythm spontaneously resumes after one or more days in the absence of neuromodulatory input. We recorded continuously for days to characterize quantitatively this recovery process. Activity bouts lasting 40-900 s began several hours after removal of neuromodulatory input and were followed by stable rhythm recovery after 1-4 days. Bout duration was not related to the intervals (0.3-800 min) between bouts. During an individual bout, the frequency rapidly increased and then decreased more slowly. Photoablation of back-filled neuromodulatory terminals in the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) neuropil had no effect on activity bouts or recovery, suggesting that these processes are intrinsic to the STG neuronal network. After removal of neuromodulatory input, the phase relationships of the components of the triphasic pyloric rhythm were altered, and then over time the phase relationships moved toward their control values. Although at low pyloric rhythm frequency the phase relationships among pyloric network neurons depended on frequency, the changes in frequency during recovery did not completely account for the change in phase seen after rhythm recovery. We suggest that activity bouts represent underlying mechanisms controlling the restructuring of the pyloric network to allow resumption of an appropriate output after removal of neuromodulatory input.},

This article reviews the evidence for CPGs governing locomotion and addresses other factors, including supraspinal, sensory, and neuromodulatory influences, that interact with CPGs to shape the final motor output. Supraspinal inputs play a major role not only in initiating locomotion but also in adapting the locomotor pattern to environmental and motivational conditions. Sensory afferents involved in muscle and cutaneous reflexes have important regulatory functions in preserving balance and ensuring stable phase transitions in the locomotor cycle. Neuromodulators evoke changes in cellular and synaptic properties of CPG neurons, conferring flexibility to CPG circuits. Briefly addressed is the interaction of CPG networks to produce intersegmental coordination for locomotion. Evidence for CPGs in humans is reviewed, and although a comprehensive clinical review is not an objective, examples are provided of animal and human studies that apply knowledge of CPG mechanisms to improve locomotion. The final section deals with future directions in CPG research. FAU - MacKay-Lyons, Marilyn},

  Abstract                 = {Short-term dynamics such as facilitation and depression are present in most synapses and are often target-specific even for synapses from the same type of neuron. We examine the dynamics and possible functions of two synapses from the same presynaptic neuron in the rhythmically active pyloric network of the spiny lobster. Using simultaneous recordings, we show that the synapses from the lateral pyloric (LP) neuron to the pyloric dilator (PD; a member of the pyloric pacemaker ensemble) and the pyloric constrictor (PY) neurons both show short-term depression. However, the postsynaptic potentials produced by the LP-to-PD synapse are larger in amplitude, depress less, and recover faster than those produced by the LP-to-PY synapse. The main function of the LP-to-PD synapse is to slow down the pyloric rhythm. However, in some cases, it slows down the rhythm only when it is fast and has no effect or to speeds up when it is slow. In contrast, the LP-to-PY synapse functions to delay the activity of the PY neuron; this delay increases as the cycle period becomes longer. Using a computational model, we show that the short-term dynamics of synaptic depression observed for each of these synapses are tailored to their individual functions and that replacing the dynamics of either synapse with the other would disrupt these functions. Together, the experimental and modeling results suggest that the target-specific features of short-term synaptic depression are functionally important for synapses efferent from the same presynaptic neuron.},

  Abstract                 = {All nervous systems are subject to neuromodulation. Neuromodulators can be delivered as local hormones, as cotransmitters in projection neurons, and through the general circulation. Because neuromodulators can transform the intrinsic firing properties of circuit neurons and alter effective synaptic strength, neuromodulatory substances reconfigure neuronal circuits, often massively altering their output. Thus, the anatomical connectome provides a minimal structure and the neuromodulatory environment constructs and specifies the functional circuits that give rise to behavior. },

  Abstract                 = {1. A study of the neurotransmitters used by each of the eleven types of excitatory motor neurones (identified according to the muscle innervated) of the lobster stomatogastric ganglion was undertaken. 2. The dorsal dilator muscle is innervated by the two motor neurones designated 'PD'. Bath and iontophoretic applications of acetylcholine (ACh) produce contractures and depolarizations respectively in the dorsal dilator muscle. 3. Pharmacological experiments support the cholinergic nature of the excitatory junctional potentials (e.j.p.s) recorded in the dorsal dilator muscle when the PD motor nerve is stimulated. 4. The apparent reversal potentials for the e.j.p.s and the iontophoretic ACh response in the dorsal dilator muscle are the same. 5. On the basis of choline acetyltransferase assays on identified stomatogastric ganglion motor neurone somata and tension measurements on the muscles innervated by each type of stomatogastric ganglion motor neurone, a transmitter candidate was established for each type of motor neurone. Motor neurones named VD, LPG, GM, MG, LG, and DG are putatively cholinergic. L-Glutamate is a transmitter candidate for the motor neurones called LP, PY, IC, and AM. 6. Potential correlations between the distribution of putatively cholinergic and glutaminergic motor neurones and the electrical coupling among the stomatogastric ganglion motor neurones are discussed.},

Computational and experimental studies of single-neuron and network homeostatic regulation have provided insight into compensatory mechanisms that can underlie stable network performance. Many of the observations first made using the stomatogastric nervous system can be generalized to other invertebrate and vertebrate circuits.},

General principles of the organization of these circuits and their control by higher brain centers have come from the study of smaller circuits found in invertebrates. Recent work on vertebrates highlights the importance of neuro-modulatory control pathways in enabling spinal cord and brain stem circuits to generate meaningful motor patterns. Because rhythmic motor patterns are easily quantified and studied, central pattern generators will provide important testing grounds for understanding the effects of numerous genetic mutations on behavior. Moreover, further understanding of the modulation of spinal cord circuitry used in rhythmic behaviors should facilitate the development of new treatments to enhance recovery after spinal cord damage.},

Consequently network dynamics can be tuned and configured in different ways, as a function of the actions of neuromodulators. General principles of the organization of modulatory systems in nervous systems include: (a) many neurons and networks are multiply modulated, (b) there is extensive convergence and divergence in modulator action, and (c) some modulators may be released extrinsically to the modulated circuit, while others may be released by some of the circuit neurons themselves, and act intrinsically.

In addition, the elaboration of the output signal of the neuron may involve all the morphological regions of the subunits of the neuron: somatodendritic integration of synaptic inputs through linear and nonlinear processes, generation and patterning of action potentials trains in the axo-somatic region, selective distribution of these action potentials to the post-synaptic neurons in the axonal arborization. The behavior of neurons may change depending on their working environmentâ€”that is, on the physiological state of the animal and the task performed because of variations of the average synaptic input or neuromodulation. In this chapter, many conceptual advances on the operation of the neuron made in the past have relied on mathematically simple models, not on detailed models of neurons trying to incorporate all the geometric and electric complexity of neurons revealed by experiments. },

  Abstract                 = {Hodgkin and Huxley (Hâ€“H) model for action potential generation has held firm for half a century because this relatively simple and experimentally testable model embodies the major features of membrane nonlinearity: namely, voltage-dependent ionic currents that activate and inactivate in time. However, experimental and theoretical developments of the past 20 years force one to re-evaluate its usefulness. First, the Hâ€“H model is, in its original form, limited to the two voltage-dependent currents found in the squid giant axon and it must be extended significantly if it is to deal with the excitable soma and dendrites of neurons. Second, the macroscopic and deterministic Hâ€“H model does not capture correctly the kinetics of the Na+ channel and it cannot account for the stochastic response to current injection that arises from the discrete nature of ion channels. Third, much simpler integrate-and-fire-type models seem to be more useful for exploring collective phenomena in neuronal networks. Is the Hâ€“H model threatened, or will it continue to set the fundamental framework for exploring neuronal excitability? },

  Abstract                 = {1. In three preceding papers in this series (6, 33, 45), the functional roles, intrinsic cellular properties, and synaptic connections of identified neurons in the lobster stomatogastric ganglion were investigated using the dye-sensitized photoinactivation technique. In this paper, we investigate the network properties of the pyloric system. 2. The relative strengths of the synaptic interactions between all possible motor neuron pairs were measured from the neuronal cell bodies. 3. Experiments were performed to determine the minimal subset of the pyloric neurons that could generate rhythmic activity due to network interactions alone. With the endogenously bursting anterior burster (AB) cell excluded from consideration, the minimum number of elements was found to be two. These two elements behaved as a classical "half-center" oscillator when their overall activity levels were appropriately adjusted. 4. Two cells in the commissural ganglia supply the pyloric system with rhythmic excitatory input phase locked to ongoing pyloric activity. The rhythmicity of that input is shown to be functionally irrelevant. The inputs can exert their effects on pyloric system activity through tonic firing. 5. A qualitative explanation of three important aspects of the pyloric motor pattern is presented, based on the intrinsic properties of pyloric neurons and the systematic properties of the network they form. The existence of the pattern results from oscillatory membrane properties of the individual neurons in combination with the multiple reciprocally inhibitory interactions within the network. The phase relationships derive from the synaptic connectivity and depend on relative synaptic strengths, postinhibitory rebound, rebound delay, and the kinetics of the plateau and bursting pacemaker-potential generation mechanisms. The overall pattern frequency is determined by the AB interneuron via its intrinsic oscillatory behavior and strong synapses with the rest of the pyloric neurons.},

  Abstract                 = {Barnacle muscle fibers subjected to constant current stimulation produce a variety of types of oscillatory behavior when the internal medium contains the Ca++ chelator EGTA. Oscillations are abolished if Ca++ is removed from the external medium, or if the K+ conductance is blocked. Available voltage-clamp data indicate that the cell's active conductance systems are exceptionally simple. Given the complexity of barnacle fiber voltage behavior, this seems paradoxical. This paper presents an analysis of the possible modes of behavior available to a system of two noninactivating conductance mechanisms, and indicates a good correspondence to the types of behavior exhibited by barnacle fiber. The differential equations of a simple equivalent circuit for the fiber are dealt with by means of some of the mathematical techniques of nonlinear mechanics. General features of the system are (a) a propensity to produce damped or sustained oscillations over a rather broad parameter range, and (b) considerable latitude in the shape of the oscillatory potentials. It is concluded that for cells subject to changeable parameters (either from cell to cell or with time during cellular activity), a system dominated by two noninactivating conductances can exhibit varied oscillatory and bistable behavior.},

However, unlike for electrophysiological signals, standardized algorithms for assigning optically recorded signals to individual cells have not yet emerged. Here, we describe an automated sorting procedure that combines independent component analysis and image segmentation for extracting cells' locations and their dynamics with minimal human supervision. In validation studies using simulated data, automated sorting significantly improved estimation of cellular signals compared to conventional analysis based on image regions of interest. We used automated procedures to analyze data recorded by two-photon Ca2+ imaging in the cerebellar vermis of awake behaving mice. Our analysis yielded simultaneous Ca2+ activity traces for up to >100 Purkinje cells and Bergmann glia from single recordings. Using this approach, we found microzones of Purkinje cells that were stable across behavioral states and in which synchronous Ca2+ spiking rose significantly during locomotion. Â© 2009 Elsevier Inc.

  Abstract                 = {Neuromodulation underlies the flexibility of neural circuit operation and behavior. Individual neuromodulators can have divergent actions in a neuron by targeting multiple physiological mechanisms. Conversely, multiple neuromodulators may have convergent actions through overlapping targets. The divergent and convergent neuromodulator actions can be unambiguously synergistic or antagonistic, but neuromodulation often entails balanced adjustment of nonlinear membrane and synaptic properties by targeting ion channel and synaptic dynamics rather than just excitability or synaptic strength. In addition, neuromodulators can exert effects at multiple timescales, from short-term adjustments of neuron and synapse function to persistent long-term regulation. This short review summarizes some highlights of the diverse actions of neuromodulators on ion channel and synaptic properties. },

  Abstract                 = {We analyze simple morphological configurations that represent gap-junctional coupling between neuronal processes or between muscle fibers. Specifically, we use cable theory and simulations to examine the consequences of current flow from one cable to other gap-junctionally coupled passive cables. When the proximal end of the first cable is voltage clamped, the amplitude of the electrical signal in distal portions of the second cable depends on the cable diameter. However, this amplitude does not simply increase if cable diameter is increased, as expected from the larger length constant; instead, an optimal diameter exists. The optimal diameter arises because the dependency of voltage attenuation along the second cable on cable diameter follows two opposing rules. As cable diameter increases, the attenuation decreases because of a larger length constant yet increases because of a reduction in current density arising from the limiting effect of the gap junction on current flow into the second cable. The optimal diameter depends on the gap junction resistance and cable parameters. In branched cables, dependency on diameter is local and thus may serve to functionally compartmentalize branches that are coupled to other cells. Such compartmentalization may be important when periodic signals or action potentials cause the current flow across gap junctions.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a quantitative model for the phototransduction cascade in Drosophila photoreceptors. The process consists of four stages: (1) light absorption by Rhodopsin, (2) signal amplification phase mediated by a G-protein coupled cascade, (3) closed/open state kinetics of the transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels which regulate the ionic current in/out of the cell and (4) Ca regulated positive and negative feedbacks. The model successfully reproduces the experimental results for: single photon absorption "quantum bump" (QB), statistical features for QB (average shape, peak current average value and variance, the latency distribution, etc.), arrestin mutant behaviour, low extracellular Ca(2+) cases, etc. The TRP channel activity is modeled by a Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model for allosteric interaction, instead of using the usual ad hoc Hill equation. This approach allows for a plausible physical explanation of how Ca/calmodulin regulate the protein activity. The cooperative nature of the TRP channel activation leads to "dark current" suppression at the output allowing for reliable detection of a single photon. Stochastic simulations were produced by using the standard rate equations combined with the Poisson distribution for generating random events from the forward and reverse reaction rates. Noise is inherent to the system but appears to be crucial for producing such reliable responses in this complex, highly non-linear system. The approach presented here may serve as a useful example how to treat complex cellular mechanisms underlying sensory processes.},

Four identified pairs of heart interneurons make a staggered pattern of inhibitory synaptic connections with segmental heart motor neurons. Using extracellular recording from multiple interneurons in the network in 56 isolated nerve cords, we show that this pattern generator produces a side-to-side asymmetric pattern of intersegmental coordination among ipsilateral premotor interneurons. This pattern corresponds to a similarly asymmetric fictive motor pattern in heart motor neurons and asymmetric constriction pattern of the two tubular hearts, synchronous and peristaltic. We provide a quantitative description of the firing pattern of all the premotor interneurons, including phase, duty cycle, and intraburst frequency of this premotor activity pattern. This analysis identifies two stereotypical coordination modes corresponding to synchronous and peristaltic, which show phase constancy over a broad range of periods as do the fictive motor pattern and the heart constriction pattern. Coordination mode is controlled through one segmental pair of heart interneurons (switch interneurons). Side-to-side switches in coordination mode are a regular feature of this pattern generator and occur with changes in activity state of these switch interneurons. Associated with synchronous coordination of premotor interneurons, the ipsilateral switch interneuron is in an active state, during which it produces rhythmic bursts, whereas associated with peristaltic coordination, the ipsilateral switch interneuron is largely silent. We argue that timing and pattern elaboration are separate functions produced by overlapping subnetworks in the heartbeat central pattern generator.},

Four of the identified pairs and the unidentified pair of interneurons make inhibitory synaptic connections with segmental heart motor neurons. The CPG produces a side-to-side asymmetric pattern of intersegmental coordination among ipsilateral premotor interneurons corresponding to a similarly asymmetric fictive motor pattern in heart motor neurons, and asymmetric constriction pattern of the two tubular hearts: synchronous and peristaltic. Using extracellular techniques, we recorded, in 61 isolated nerve cords, the activity of motor neurons in conjunction with the phase reference premotor heart interneuron, HN(4), and another premotor interneuron that allowed us to assess the coordination mode. These data were then coupled with a previous description of the temporal pattern of premotor interneuron activity in the two coordination modes to synthesize a global phase diagram for the known elements of the CPG and the entire motor neuron ensemble. These average data reveal the stereotypical side-to-side asymmetric patterns of intersegmental coordination among the motor neurons and show how this pattern meshes with the activity pattern of premotor interneurons. Analysis of animal-to-animal variability in this coordination indicates that the intersegmental phase progression of motor neuron activity in the midbody in the peristaltic coordination mode is the most stereotypical feature of the fictive motor pattern. Bilateral recordings from motor neurons corroborate the main features of the asymmetric motor pattern. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2007 by the American Physiological Society},

  Abstract                 = {The ability of neuropeptides to modulate neural circuit activity is well established, but little is known regarding how the actions of neurally-released peptides are regulated. This issue is being studied in the isolated stomatogastric nervous system (STNS) of decapod crustaceans. The STNS is a small neural system that contains the rhythmically active gastric mill (chewing) and pyloric (filtering of chewed food) motor circuits within the stomatogastric ganglion (STG). These circuits are influenced by a set of modulatory projection neurons in the neighboring commissural and oesophageal ganglia. This system includes three different projection neurons that contain the peptide transmitter proctolin among an overlapping complement of cotransmitters. Despite their shared proctolinergic phenotype, when these projection neurons are activated individually each of them has distinct actions on the gastric mill and pyloric circuits. These distinct actions result only partly from the presence of different cotransmitters in these projection neurons. Also contributing to these distinct actions are differences in the pattern of transmitter release as well as a differential, peptidase-mediated sculpting of the actions of the proctolin released from each projection neuron. There is also a convergence of peptide cotransmitter actions, at the level of the target ion channel, which might limit the effectiveness of each individual cotransmitter. One lesson already learned from this small neural system is that there is a diverse collection of regulatory mechanisms for controlling the actions of neurally-released peptides on rhythmically active neural circuits.},

RPLI was seen in neuropilar processes in the stomatogastric ganglion (STG), and in somata in the oesophageal ganglion and commissural ganglia. Staining was blocked by preincubating the antiserum with RPCH, as well as with a number of adipokinetic hormones (AKHs) and related peptides. Synthetic RPCH had strong actions on the pyloric rhythm of the isolated STG. Bath applications of RPCH (10 ~ 9-10 ~ 6 moll~&#039;) increased the cycle frequency in preparations displaying slow pyloric rhythms, and initiated rhythmic pyloric activity in silent preparations. In the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX), RPCH evoked rhythmic non-impulse-mediated alternations in membrane potential in the lateral pyloric and pyloric dilator motor neurones. The effects of RPCH were compared to those of a series of AKHs which resemble RPCH structurally. The immunocytochemical and physiological data together suggest that RPCH or a similar molecule is a neurally released modulator of the STG.},

Patients with FoG, which is a feature of parkinsonian syndromes, show variability in gait metrics between FoG episodes and a substantial reduction in step length with frequent trembling of the legs during FoG episodes. Physiological, functional imaging, and clinical–pathological studies point to disturbances in frontal cortical regions, the basal ganglia, and the midbrain locomotor region as the probable origins of FoG. Medications, deep brain stimulation, and rehabilitation techniques can alleviate symptoms of FoG in some patients, but these treatments lack efficacy in patients with advanced FoG. A better understanding of the phenomenon is needed to aid the development of effective therapeutic strategies. },

These are the first optical recordings of electrical activity with single-cell resolution from a mammalian nervous system. They are used to investigate the effects of acute and chronic application of nicotine on the firing patterns of this neural network containing important cholinergic components. After washout of acutely applied nicotine, the firing rates of selected neurons were dramatically elevated. These results suggest that nAChRs that reversibly desensitize after exposure to nicotine may be responsible for the enhancement of activity that is observed after a brief application of this agonist. In addition, immunostaining with monoclonal antibodies was used to localize alpha3/alpha5, alpha7, and beta2 nAChR subunits, and the results demonstrate the prevalence of alpha3/alpha5.

The key advantage is the capability to record and stimulate neurons at multiple sites simultaneously. However, unlike the single-cell or single-channel resolution of intracellular recording, microelectrodes detect signals from all possible sources around every sensor. Here, we review the current understanding of microelectrode signals and the techniques for analyzing them. We introduce the ongoing advancements in microelectrode technology, with focus on achieving higher resolution and quality of recordings by means of monolithic integration with on-chip circuitry. We show how recent advanced microelectrode array measurement methods facilitate the understanding of single neurons as well as network function.},

However, common methods for performing inference in state-space models with non-Gaussian observations rely on certain approximations which are not always accurate. Here we review direct optimization methods that avoid these approximations, but that nonetheless retain the computational efficiency of the approximate methods. We discuss a variety of examples, applying these direct optimization techniques to problems in spike train smoothing, stimulus decoding, parameter estimation, and inference of synaptic properties. Along the way, we point out connections to some related standard statistical methods, including spline smoothing and isotonic regression. Finally, we note that the computational methods reviewed here do not in fact depend on the state-space setting at all; instead, the key property we are exploiting involves the bandedness of certain matrices. We close by discussing some applications of this more general point of view, including Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for neural decoding and efficient estimation of spatially-varying firing rates.},

  Abstract                 = {Whisker movement is somatotopically represented in rodent neocortex by electrical activity in clearly defined barrels, which can be visualized in living brain slices. The functional architecture of this part of the cortex can thus be mapped in vitro with respect to its physiological input and compared with its anatomical architecture. The spatial extent of excitation was measured at high temporal resolution by imaging optical signals from voltage-sensitive dye evoked by stimulation of individual barrels in layer 4. The optical signals correlated closely with subthreshold EPSPs recorded simultaneously from excitatory neurons in layer 4 and layer 2/3, respectively. Excitation was initially (<2 msec) limited to the stimulated barrel and subsequently (>3 msec) spread in a columnar manner into layer 2/3 and then subsided in both layers after âˆ¼50 msec. The lateral extent of the response was limited to the cortical column defined structurally by the barrel in layer 4. Two experimental interventions increased the spread of excitation. First, blocking GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic inhibition caused excitation to spread laterally throughout wide regions of layer 2/3 and layer 5 but not into neighboring barrels, suggesting that the local excitatory connections within layer 4 are restricted to single barrels and that inhibitory neurons control spread in supragranular and infragranular layers. Second, NMDA receptor-dependent increase of the spread of excitation was induced by pairing repetitive stimulation of a barrel column with coincident stimulation of layer 2/3 in a neighboring column. Such plasticity in the spatial extent of excitation in a barrel column could underlie changes in cortical map structure induced by alterations of sensory experience.},

However, in spite of the widespread celebration of his work, Galvani's scientific endeavours have been largely misrepresented in the history of science. The scholar of Bologna has a stereotyped image as an `occasional' scientist, who started his studies by chance, largely ignored the scientific theories of his time and wandered aimlessly in mental elaborations until the physicist of Pavia, Alessandro Volta, entered the field, correctly interpreted Galvani's results and eventually developed the electric battery. &#xa0;With the present understanding of electrical phenomena in excitable membranes, it is now time to reconsider the real matter raised by Galvani's discoveries and by his hypothesis of an intrinsic `animal electricity', and to make a clearer evaluation of a revolutionary phase of scientific progress.},

  Abstract                 = {Several motor networks have now been found to be multifunctional, in which one group of neurons participates in the generation of multiple behavioral motor programs. Not surprisingly, the behaviors involved are frequently closely related, often using the same or similar muscle groups. Here we describe an interneuronal network in the marine mollusk Tritonia diomedea that is involved in producing two highly dissimilar behaviors, rhythmic, muscle-based escape swimming and nonrhythmic, cilia-mediated crawling. Several observations support this conclusion. First, the dorsal swim interneurons (DSIs) of the swim central pattern generator (CPG) directly excite Pedal neuron 21 (Pd21) and Pd5, the only identified cilia-activating efferent neurons in Tritonia. Second, stimulation of a single DSI elicits beating of the foot cilia in semi-intact preparations and crawling in intact animal treadmill preparations. Third, the DSIs fire at an elevated rate for nearly 1 hr after a swim motor program, which correlates reasonably well with the period freely behaving animals were found to crawl after they swam. Fourth, silencing the tonically active DSIs after a swim motor program substantially reduces or eliminates ongoing cilia neuron firing, indicating that the DSIs are major contributors to the synaptic input driving these cells. Finally, all of the other swim CPG neurons also connect to the cilia neurons, most monosynaptically. Taken together, these observations indicate that the Tritonia swim CPG network participates in producing both escape swimming and crawling. Given the extreme differences between these behaviors—-rhythmic versus tonic, muscular versus ciliary, and brief versus prolonged—these findings reveal a striking versatility for a small multifunctional network.},

  Abstract                 = {We have developed a new method for culturing cells that maintains their health and sterility for many months. Using conventional techniques, primary neuron cultures seldom survive more than 2 months. Increases in the osmotic strength of media due to evaporation are a large and underappreciated contributor to the gradual decline in the health of these cultures. Because of this and the ever-present likelihood of contamination by airborne pathogens, repeated or extended experiments on any given culture have until now been difficult, if not impossible. We surmounted survival problems by using culture dish lids that form a gas-tight seal, and incorporate a transparent hydrophobic membrane (fluorinated ethylene-propylene) that is selectively permeable to oxygen (O(2)) and carbon dioxide (CO(2)), and relatively impermeable to water vapor. This prevents contamination and greatly reduces evaporation, allowing the use of a non-humidified incubator. We have employed this technique to grow dissociated cortical cultures from rat embryos on multi-electrode arrays. After more than a year in culture, the neurons still exhibit robust spontaneous electrical activity. The combination of sealed culture dishes with extracellular multi-electrode recording and stimulation enables study of development, adaptation, and very long-term plasticity, across months, in cultured neuronal networks. Membrane-sealed dishes will also be useful for the culture of many other cell types susceptible to evaporation and contamination.},

  Abstract                 = {<p>One of the key approaches for studying neural network function is the simultaneous measurement of the activity of many neurons. Voltage-sensitive dyes (VSDs) simultaneously report the membrane potential of multiple neurons, but often have pharmacological and phototoxic effects on neuronal cells. Yet, to study the homeostatic processes that regulate neural network function long-term recordings of neuronal activities are required. This study aims to test the suitability of the VSDs RH795 and Di-4-ANEPPS for optically recording pattern generating neurons in the stomatogastric nervous system of crustaceans with an emphasis on long-term recordings of the pyloric central pattern generator. We demonstrate that both dyes stain pyloric neurons and determined an optimal concentration and light intensity for optical imaging. Although both dyes provided sufficient signal-to-noise ratio for measuring membrane potentials, Di-4-ANEPPS displayed a higher signal quality indicating an advantage of this dye over RH795 when small neuronal signals need to be recorded. For Di-4-ANEPPS, higher dye concentrations resulted in faster and brighter staining. Signal quality, however, only depended on excitation light strength, but not on dye concentration. RH795 showed weak and slowly developing phototoxic effects on the pyloric motor pattern as well as slow bleaching of the staining and is thus the better choice for long-term experiments. Low concentrations and low excitation intensities can be used as, in contrast to Di-4-ANEPPS, the signal-to-noise ratio was independent of excitation light strength. In summary, RH795 and Di-4-ANEPPS are suitable for optical imaging in the stomatogastric nervous system of crustaceans. They allow simultaneous recording of the membrane potential of multiple neurons with high signal quality. While Di-4-ANEPPS is better suited for short-term experiments that require high signal quality, RH795 is a better candidate for long-term experiments since it has only minor effects on the motor pattern.</p>},

First published August 27, 2003; 10.1152/jn.00641.2003. Conven-
tionally, the parameters of neuronal models are hand-tuned using
trial-and-error searches to produce a desired behavior. Here, we
present an alternative approach. We have generated a database of
about 1.7 million single-compartment model neurons by indepen-
dently varying 8 maximal membrane conductances based on measure-
ments from lobster stomatogastric neurons. We classiﬁed the sponta-
neous electrical activity of each model neuron and its responsiveness
to inputs during runtime with an adaptive algorithm and saved a
reduced version of each neuron’s activity pattern. Our analysis of the
distribution of different activity types (silent, spiking, bursting, irreg-
ular) in the 8-dimensional conductance space indicates that the coarse
grid of conductance values we chose is sufﬁcient to capture the salient
features of the distribution. The database can be searched for different
combinations of neuron properties such as activity type, spike or burst
frequency, resting potential, frequency–current relation, and phase-
response curve. We demonstrate how the database can be screened for
models that reproduce the behavior of a speciﬁc biological neuron and
show that the contents of the database can give insight into the way a
neuron’s membrane conductances determine its activity pattern and
response properties. Similar databases can be constructed to explore
parameter spaces in multicompartmental models or small networks, or
to examine the effects of changes in the voltage dependence of
currents. In all cases, database searches can provide insight into how
neuronal and network properties depend on the values of the param-
eters in the models.},

We found that virtually indistinguishable network activity can arise from widely disparate sets of underlying mechanisms, suggesting that there could be considerable animal-to-animal variability in many of the parameters that control network activity, and that many different combinations of synaptic strengths and intrinsic membrane properties can be consistent with appropriate network performance.},

In the model and the biological neuron, the change in burst period caused by inhibitory and excitatory inputs of increasing strength saturated, such that synaptic inputs above a certain strength all had the same effect on the firing pattern of the oscillatory neuron. In contrast, increasing the duration of the synaptic conductance pulses always led to changes in the burst period, indicating that neural oscillators are sensitive to changes in the duration of synaptic input but are not sensitive to changes in the strength of synaptic inputs above a certain conductance. This saturation of the response to progressively stronger synaptic inputs occurs not only in bursting neurons but also in tonically spiking neurons. We identified inward currents at hyperpolarized potentials as the cause of the saturation in the model neuron. Our findings imply that activity-dependent or modulator-induced changes in synaptic strength are not necessarily accompanied by changes in the functional impact of a synapse on the timing of postsynaptic spikes or bursts.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent studies have found electrical coupling to be more ubiquitous than previously thought, and coupling through gap junctions is known to play a crucial role in neuronal function and network output. In particular, current spread through gap junctions may affect the activation of voltage-dependent conductances as well as chemical synaptic release. Using voltage-clamp recordings of two strongly electrically coupled neurons of the lobster stomatogastric ganglion and conductance-based models of these neurons, we identified effects of electrical coupling on the measurement of leak and voltage-gated outward currents, as well as synaptic potentials. Experimental measurements showed that both leak and voltage-gated outward currents are recruited by gap junctions from neurons coupled to the clamped cell. Nevertheless, in spite of the strong coupling between these neurons, the errors made in estimating voltage-gated conductance parameters were relatively minor (<10\%). Thus in many cases isolation of coupled neurons may not be required if a small degree of measurement error of the voltage-gated currents or the synaptic potentials is acceptable. Modeling results show, however, that such errors may be as high as 20\% if the gap-junction position is near the recording site or as high as 90\% when measuring smaller voltage-gated ionic currents. Paradoxically, improved space clamp increases the errors arising from electrical coupling because voltage control across gap junctions is poor for even the highest realistic coupling conductances. Furthermore, the common procedure of leak subtraction can add an extra error to the conductance measurement, the sign of which depends on the maximal conductance.},

  Abstract                 = {Electrical coupling through gap junctions constitutes a mode of signal transmission between neurons (electrical synaptic transmission). Originally discovered in invertebrates and in lower vertebrates, electrical synapses have recently been reported in immature and adult mammalian nervous systems. This has renewed the interest in understanding the role of electrical synapses in neural circuit function and signal processing. The present review focuses on the role of gap junctions in shaping the dynamics of neural networks by forming electrical synapses between neurons. Electrical synapses have been shown to be important elements in coincidence detection mechanisms and they can produce complex input-output functions when arranged in combination with chemical synapses. We postulate that these synapses may also be important in redefining neuronal compartments, associating anatomically distinct cellular structures into functional units. The original view of electrical synapses as static connecting elements in neural circuits has been revised and a considerable amount of evidence suggests that electrical synapses substantially affect the dynamics of neural circuits.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

To optimize the development of noise-based sensory prosthetics, it is important to have an understanding of the effects of electrical stimulation on the somatosensory system. The chapter briefly describes the anatomy of the somatosensory system, as it relates to electrical stimulation. It reviews some of the key neurophysiological and psychophysical studies that have involved somatosensory stimulation. The chapter also discusses computational studies that explore the effects of electrical stimulation on cutaneous mechanoreception. These computational studies provide a series of novel predictions that can be tested in neurophysiological and psychophysical studies. The information derived from such studies could be incorporated into the optimal design of noise-based somatosensory prosthetics. },

Discrete methods based on transition graphs are applied to dynamic biological networks to generate sets of possible rhythmic behaviours. A measure is introduced onto the set of rhythms to quantify their differences and organize the set according to clusters of similar rhythms. Each cluster represents a different operational mode of the network. Examples are drawn from the stomatogastric ganglion, a well studied network that controls the muscles in the foregut of crustaceans. Classes of rhythms are found that correspond to experimentally observed patterns, and other classes of rhythms are found that have not yet been observed.

  Abstract                 = {The anterior burster (AB) neuron in the stomatogastric ganglion of the spiny lobster, /Janu/ifus interruptus, is a conditional burster in the pyloric motor circuit. Bath application of the monoamines dopamine, serotonin, and octopamine induces rhythmic bursting pacemaker potentials in a silent, synaptically isolated AB cell. However, each amine produces a unique and characteristic burst shape, resulting from different ionic dependences of the burst mechanisms. Bursting induced by serotonin or octopamine is critically dependent upon sodium entry through tetrodotoxin-sensitive channels; dopamine-induced bursting is not TTX-sensitive. Dopamineinduced bursting is abolished when extracellular calcium is reduced to 25 % of normal; serotonin- and octopamine-induced bursts continue in this saline, although they are abolished in salines with calcium reduced to 10 % or less of normal. Quantitative differences between the amines are also seen in the tetraethylammonium (TEA) sensitivity of the burst amplitude and in the dependence of the interburst hyperpolarization on extracellular potassium. These experiments demonstrate that there are both quantitative and qualitative differences in the ionic currents underlying every phase of the bursts induced by the 3 amines. Thus, a single neuron can burst via more than one ionic mechanism. Endogenously bursting neurons have been detected in a number},

A single axon from these mesohabenular neurons coexpresses VGluT2 protein and VGaT protein and, surprisingly, establishes symmetric and asymmetric synapses on LHb neurons. In LHb slices, light activation of mesohabenular fibers expressing channelrhodopsin2 driven by VGluT2 (Slc17a6) or VGaT (Slc32a1) promoters elicits release of both glutamate and GABA onto single LHb neurons. In vivo light activation of mesohabenular terminals inhibits or excites LHb neurons. Our findings reveal an unanticipated type of VTA neuron that cotransmits glutamate and GABA and provides the majority of mesohabenular inputs.},

The properties of phase synchronization in chaotic systems are similar to those of synchronization in periodic noisy oscillators. Synchronization plays an important role in several neurological diseases such as epilepsies and pathological tremors. The chapter reviews the ideas and results of theoretical studies of the synchronization phenomena that are used to time series analysis. The chapter presents techniques of the bivariate data analysis and illustrates them by examples of physiological data.

  Abstract                 = {Cortical processing of auditory stimuli involves large populations of neurons with distinct individual response profiles. However, the functional organization and dynamics of local populations in the auditory cortex have remained largely unknown. Using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging, we examined the response profiles and network dynamics of layer 2/3 neurons in the primary auditory cortex (A1) of mice in response to pure tones. We found that local populations in A1 were highly heterogeneous in the large-scale tonotopic organization. Despite the spatial heterogeneity, the tendency of neurons to respond together (measured as noise correlation) was high on average. This functional organization and high levels of noise correlations are consistent with the existence of partially overlapping cortical subnetworks. Our findings may account for apparent discrepancies between ordered large-scale organization and local heterogeneity.},

  Abstract                 = {Electrical coupling through gap junctions constitutes a mode of signal transmission between neurons (electrical synaptic transmission). Originally discovered in invertebrates and in lower vertebrates, electrical synapses have recently been reported in immature and adult mammalian nervous systems. This has renewed the interest in understanding the role of electrical synapses in neural circuit function and signal processing. The present review focuses on the role of gap junctions in shaping the dynamics of neural networks by forming electrical synapses between neurons. Electrical synapses have been shown to be important elements in coincidence detection mechanisms and they can produce complex input-output functions when arranged in combination with chemical synapses. We postulate that these synapses may also be important in redefining neuronal compartments, associating anatomically distinct cellular structures into functional units. The original view of electrical synapses as static connecting elements in neural circuits has been revised and a considerable amount of evidence suggests that electrical synapses substantially affect the dynamics of neural circuits.},

  Abstract                 = {The mammalian spinal cord contains a locomotor central pattern generator (CPG) that can produce alternating rhythmic activity of flexor and extensor motoneurones in the absence of rhythmic input and proprioceptive feedback. During such fictive locomotor activity in decerebrate cats, spontaneous omissions of activity occur simultaneously in multiple agonist motoneurone pools for a number of cycles. During these 'deletions', antagonist motoneurone pools usually become tonically active but may also continue to be rhythmic. The rhythmic activity that re-emerges following a deletion is often not phase shifted. This suggests that some neuronal mechanism can maintain the locomotor period when motoneurone activity fails. To account for these observations, a simplified computational model of the spinal circuitry has been developed in which the locomotor CPG consists of two levels: a half-centre rhythm generator (RG) and a pattern formation (PF) network, with reciprocal inhibitory interactions between antagonist neural populations at each level. The model represents a network of interacting neural populations with single interneurones and motoneurones described in the Hodgkin-Huxley style. The model reproduces the range of locomotor periods and phase durations observed during real locomotion in adult cats and permits independent control of the level of motoneurone activity and of step cycle timing. By altering the excitability of neural populations within the PF network, the model can reproduce deletions in which motoneurone activity fails but the phase of locomotor oscillations is maintained. The model also suggests criteria for the functional identification of spinal interneurones involved in the mammalian locomotor pattern generation.},

  Abstract                 = {In tetrapods, limb and axial movements are coordinated during locomotion. It is well established that inter- and intralimb coordination show considerable variations during ongoing locomotion. Much less is known about the flexibility of the axial musculoskeletal system during locomotion and the neural mechanisms involved. Here we examined this issue in the salamander Pleurodeles waltlii, which is capable of locomotion in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. Kinematics of the trunk and electromyograms from the mid-trunk epaxial myotomes were recorded during four locomotor behaviors in freely moving animals. A similar approach was used during rhythmic struggling movements since this would give some insight into the flexibility of the axial motor system. Our results show that each of the forms of locomotion and the struggling behavior is characterized by a distinct combination of mid-trunk motor patterns and cycle durations. Using in vitro electrophysiological recordings in isolated spinal cords, we observed that the spinal networks activated with bath-applied N-methyl-d-aspartate could generate these axial motor patterns. In these isolated spinal cord preparations, the limb motor nerve activities were coordinated with each mid-trunk motor pattern. Furthermore, isolated mid-trunk spinal cords and hemicords could generate the mid-trunk motor patterns. This indicates that each side of the cord comprises a network able to generate coordinated axial motor activity. The roles of descending and sensory inputs in the behavior-related changes in axial motor coordination are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {To fully understand neuronal network operation, the influence of all inputs onto that network must be characterized. As in most systems, many neuronal and hormonal pathways influence the multifunctional motor circuits of the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion (STG), but the actions of only some of them are known. Therefore, we characterized the influence of the kinin peptide family on the gastric mill (chewing) and pyloric (filtering of chewed food) motor circuits in the STG of the crab Cancer borealis. The kinins are myoactive in arthropods and they occur within the arthropod central nervous system (CNS), but their CNS actions are not well characterized in any species. The pevkinins were first identified in the shrimp Penaeus vannamei, but they have yet to be studied in the STG of any species. We identified kinin-like immunolabeling (KLI) in the pericardial organs (POs) in C. borealis, but there was no KLI within the STG. The POs are a major source of hormonal influence on the STG. Pevkinin peptides activated the pyloric circuit and they caused a modest increase in the speed of ongoing pyloric rhythms. This modest influence on cycle speed resulted in part from pevkinin excitation of the lateral pyloric neuron, whose strengthened inhibitory synapse onto the pyloric pacemaker neurons limited the pevkinin-mediated increase in cycle speed. The pevkinin excitation of the pyloric rhythm was not strong enough to interfere with the previously documented, gastric mill rhythm-mediated weakening of the pyloric rhythm. Pevkinin also had little influence on the gastric mill rhythm. These results indicate that the kinin peptides have distinct and selective modulatory actions on the pyloric rhythm.},

The microdrive device utilizes tetrode technology with up to six ultra-thin microprobe guide tubes (0.1. mm) that can be independently positioned, each containing reduced diameter tetrode and/or hexatrode microwires (0.02. mm) for recording and isolating single neuron activity. The microdrive device is mounted within the standard NHP cranial well and allows traversal of brain depths up to 40.0. mm. The advantages of this technology are demonstrated via simultaneously recorded large populations of neurons with tetrode type probes during task performance from a) primary motor cortex and deep brain structures (caudate-putamen and hippocampus) and b) multiple layers within the prefrontal cortex. The means to characterize interactions of well-isolated ensembles of neurons recorded simultaneously from different regions, as shown with this device, has not been previously available for application in primate brain. The device has extensive application to primate models for the detection and study of inoperative or maladaptive neural circuits related to human neurological disorders. Â© 2012.},

  Abstract                 = {Summary Huntington’s disease is caused by degeneration or malfunctioning of basal ganglia. Although the exact pathophysiology of this disease is not clear, it seems that abnormal glutamate release is involved in producing movement disorders. Few simulations are done on Huntington’s disease. Since a complex movement disorder is seen in this disease, a mathematical model is needed to analyze it. We designed a computational model based on physiological findings. The model block diagram is proposed. The glutamate abnormality of the disease is considered as an environment noise and is designated as a random number generator in the model. To designate inhibitory and excitatory effect of neurotransmitters on each block, we used Hill functions. We designated the internal behavior of blocks using a closed loop system. Proper transfer functions are assumed for each block in our model. In order to separate normal and diseased conditions, we included noise in all glutamate related blocks and put it dependent to a parameter, g. All nominal quantities used in the model are chosen by try and error. The response of the model is presented for different values of g in health and illness states. In this study, we have designated g = 1 for healthy and g = 10 for illness states. In the healthy state, our model’s output is zero. However, it produces an abrupt movement in Huntington’s disease, like what is seen in chorea. While reducing g from 10 to 3 causes the size of answer to be reduced, putting the g below 3 will cause cessation of jerky movement. Some of our model’s response properties, as the period between each two abrupt movements, size of movement and the shape of movement curve are completely stochastic, being another significant similarity between our model and the real conditions. According to all similarities between the model and Huntington’s disease, any change in the model parameters can resemble real changes. We evaluated some parameters, as substance P and \{GABA\} levels, in the basal ganglia model and showed that increasing these variables are able to ameliorate the patient’s symptoms. We suggest that prescribing drugs such as gabapentin could improve the symptoms. Surely, clinical trials are needed to validate this suggestion. },

  Abstract                 = {Publisher Summary The classical theory of synchronization distinguishes between forced synchronization by an external periodic driving force, and mutual synchronization between coupled oscillators. In both cases, manifestations of synchronization are the same. Synchronization of periodic self-sustained oscillators in the presence of noise shows that noise acts against synchronization in a sense that under the noise influence synchronization occurs only for a limited period. Synchronization includes a wide range of problems from different fields of nonlinear dynamics and statistical physics. The chapter concentrates on the synchronization of stochastic system, which exhibits the phenomenon of stochastic resonance and, therefore, possesses noise-controlled time scales. The chapter presents an illustrative example of how synchronization looks like in a periodically driven overdamped stochastic system. The classical case of synchronization of self-sustained oscillator is discussed and details of forced, mutual, and synchronization under noisy perturbation are presented in the chapter. The chapter provides several examples of synchronization in chaos and excitable media. Synchronization of stochastic systems by external signals and synchronization of stochastic resonance systems are discussed in the chapter. },

  Abstract                 = {Biological networks have so many possible states that exhaustive sampling is impossible. Successful analysis thus depends on simplifying hypotheses, but experiments on many systems hint that complicated, higher-order interactions among large groups of elements have an important role. Here we show, in the vertebrate retina, that weak correlations between pairs of neurons coexist with strongly collective behaviour in the responses of ten or more neurons. We find that this collective behaviour is described quantitatively by models that capture the observed pairwise correlations but assume no higher-order interactions. These maximum entropy models are equivalent to Ising models, and predict that larger networks are completely dominated by correlation effects. This suggests that the neural code has associative or error-correcting properties, and we provide preliminary evidence for such behaviour. As a first test for the generality of these ideas, we show that similar results are obtained from networks of cultured cortical neurons.},

  Abstract                 = {Mesocotical dopamine (DA) inputs to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) play a crtical role in normal cognitive process and neuropsychiatic pathologies. This \{DA\} input regulates aspects of working memory function, planning and attention, and its dysfunctions may underlie positive and negative symtoms and cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia. Despite intense research, there is still a lack of clear understanding of the basic principles of actions of \{DA\} in the PFC. In recent years, there has been considerable efforts by many groups to understand the cellular mechanisms of \{DA\} modulation of \{PFC\} neurons. However, the results of these efforts often lead to contradictions and controversies. One principal feature of \{DA\} that is agreed by most researchers is that \{DA\} is a neuromodulator and is clearly not an excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmitter. The present article aims to identify certain principles of \{DA\} mechanisms by drawing on published, as well as unpublished data from \{PFC\} and other \{CNS\} sites to shed light on aspects of \{DA\} neuromodulation and address some of the existing controversies. Eighteen key features about \{DA\} modulation have been identified. These points directly impact on the end result of \{DA\} neuromodulation, and in some cases explain why \{DA\} does not yield identical effects under all experimental conditions. It will become apparent that DA's actions in \{PFC\} are subtle and depend on a variety of factors that can no longer be ignored. Some of these key factors include distinct bell-shaped dose–response profiles of postsynaptic \{DA\} effects, different postsynaptic responses that are contingent on the duration of \{DA\} receptor stimulation, prolonged duration effects, bidirectional effects following activation of \{D1\} and \{D2\} classes of receptors and membrane potential state and history dependence of subsequent \{DA\} actions. It is hoped that these factors will be borne in mind in future research and as a result a more consistent picture of \{DA\} neuromodulation in the \{PFC\} will emerge. Based on these factors, a theory is proposed for DA's action in PFC. This theory suggests that \{DA\} acts to expand or contract the breadth of information held in working memory buffers in \{PFC\} networks. },

Electrical microstimulation in these regions elicits short-latency contralateral saccades. To determine how spatiotemporal dynamics of microstimulation-evoked activity are converted into saccade plans, we used a combination of real-time optical imaging and microstimulation in behaving monkeys. Short stimulation trains evoked a rapid and widespread wave of depolarization followed by unexpected large and prolonged hyperpolarization. During this hyperpolarization saccades are almost exclusively ipsilateral, suggesting an important role for hyperpolarization in determining saccade goal.},

  Abstract                 = {There are now a reasonable number of invertebrate central pattern generator (CPG) circuits described in sufficient detail that a mechanistic explanation of how they work is possible. These small circuits represent the best-understood neural circuits with which to investigate how cell-to-cell synaptic connections and individual channel conductances combine to generate rhythmic and patterned output. In this review, some of the main lessons that have appeared from this analysis are discussed and concrete examples of circuits ranging from single phase to multiple phase patterns are described. While it is clear that the cellular components of any CPG are basically the same, the topology of the circuits have evolved independently to meet the particular motor requirements of each individual organism and only a few general principles of circuit operation have emerged. The principal usefulness of small systems in relation to the brain is to demonstrate in detail how cellular infrastructure can be used to generate rhythmicity and form specialized patterns in a way that may suggest how similar processes might occur in more complex systems. But some of the problems and challenges associated with applying data from invertebrate preparations to the brain are also discussed. Finally, I discuss why it is useful to have well-defined circuits with which to examine various computational models that can be validated experimentally and possibly applied to brain circuits when the details of such circuits become available.},

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT Most rhythmic behaviors are produced by a specialized ensemble of neurons found in the central nervous system. These central pattern generators (CPGs) have become a cornerstone of neuronal circuit analysis. Studying simple invertebrate nervous systems may reveal the interactions of the neurons involved in the production of rhythmic motor output. There has recently been progress in this area, but due to certain intrinsic features of CPGs it is unlikely that present techniques will ever yield a complete understanding of any but the simplest of them. The chief impediment seems to be our inability to identify and characterize the total interneuronal pool making up a CPG. In addition, our general analytic strategy relies on a descriptive, reductionist approach, with no analytical constructs beyond phenomenological modeling. Detailed descriptive data are usually not of sufficient depth for specific model testing, giving rise instead to ad hoc explanations of mechanisms which usually turn out to be incorrect. Because they make too many assumptions, modeling studies have not added much to our understanding of CPCs; this is due not so much to inadequate simulations as to the poor quality and incomplete nature of the data provided by experimentalists.A basic strategy that would provide sufficient information for neural modeling would include: (1) identifying and characterizing each element in the CPG network; (2) specifying the synaptic connectivity between the elements; and (3) analyzing nonlinear synaptic properties and interactions by means of the connectivity matrix. Limitations based on our present technical capabilities are also discussed. },

  Abstract                 = {A. I. Selverston and J. P. MillerAbstract 1. Four factors contribute to pattern generation in the pyloric network of the lobster stomatogastric ganglion. These are: a) endogenously oscillating neurons; b) synaptic network properties; c) nonlinear cellular properties, including the generation of plateau potentials; and d) excitatory input from the commissural ganglia. The roles and relative importance of these factors were investigated with a new technique for inactivating single specific identified neurons. 2. In stomatogastric ganglia in which the excitatory input is left intact, a) pattern generation continues when any cell or pair of cells other than the endogenous bursters are inactivated, b) pattern generation also continues when the endogenous bursters are inactivated, c) pattern generation ceases when the endogenous bursters plus one other particular cell are inactivated. This cell, although not an endogenous burster, displays a strong tendency to generate plateau potentials. 3. In stomatogastric ganglia that have been isolated from excitatory input, a) pattern generation continues when any cell or pair of cells other than the endogenous bursters are inactivated, b) pattern generation ceases when the endogenous bursters are inactivated. 4. Some of the inputs to the stomatogastric ganglion normally fire in bursts. However, their potentiation and acceleration of the output pattern are also produced by tonic stimulation of the nerve. The effect of one of those inputs is mimicked by bath application of dopamine to the stomatogastric ganglion. 5. The roles and importance of the three most important factors were qualitatively summarized in a chart specifying the activity of the network as a function of its intactness.

  Abstract                 = {Current understanding of many neural circuits is limited by our ability to explore the vast number of potential interactions between different cells. We present a new approach that dramatically reduces the complexity of this problem. Large-scale multi-electrode recordings were used to measure electrical activity in nearly complete, regularly spaced mosaics of several hundred ON and OFF parasol retinal ganglion cells in macaque monkey retina. Parasol cells exhibited substantial pairwise correlations, as has been observed in other species, indicating functional connectivity. However, pairwise measurements alone are insufficient to determine the prevalence of multi-neuron firing patterns, which would be predicted from widely diverging common inputs and have been hypothesized to convey distinct visual messages to the brain. The number of possible multi-neuron firing patterns is far too large to study exhaustively, but this problem may be circumvented if two simple rules of connectivity can be established: (1) multi-cell firing patterns arise from multiple pairwise interactions, and (2) interactions are limited to adjacent cells in the mosaic. Using maximum entropy methods from statistical mechanics, we show that pairwise and adjacent interactions accurately accounted for the structure and prevalence of multi-neuron firing patterns, explaining approximately 98\% of the departures from statistical independence in parasol cells and approximately 99\% of the departures that were reproducible in repeated measurements. This approach provides a way to define limits on the complexity of network interactions and thus may be relevant for probing the function of many neural circuits.},

We also identified six members of the innexin family from the lobster Homarus americanus transcriptome. These innexins show significant sequence similarity to other arthropod innexins. Using in situ hybridization and reverse transcriptase-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), we determined that all the cells in the crab STG express multiple innexin genes. Electrophysiological recordings of coupling coefficients between identified pairs of pyloric dilator (PD) cells and PD-lateral posterior gastric (LPG) neurons show that the PD-PD electrical synapse is nonrectifying while the PD-LPG synapse is apparently strongly rectifying.},

Working only with single-trial data, ICA discovered a sequence of regions corresponding to the vascular propagation of activated signals from remote loci into the blood vessels. The vascular signals form a novel map of cortical function--the functional angioarchitecture--superimposed upon the cortical functional architecture. Furthermore, the incorporation of temporal aspects in optical data permitted the tuning of the inferior parietal lobule to be tracked in time through the task, demonstrating the expression of unusual tuning properties that might be exploited for higher cognitive functions.},

  Abstract                 = {The operation of central pattern generators (CPGs), oscillatory neural circuits responsible for rhythmic motor behavior, is now known to depend both on the synaptic interactions between constituent neurons and their intrinsic membrane properties (oscillatory, plateauing, etc). Moreover, these synaptic and cellular properties are not invariant, but are subject to a wide range of neuromodulatory influences that, by modifying the bioelectrical character of individual neurons and/or the strength of their synapses, are able to adapt the output of a given CPG circuit to the changing needs of the animal. Despite this ability to produce different functional configurations, however, the assumption remains of a CPG as a predefined assemblage of interconnected neurons dedicated to a particular behavior and functionally distinguishable from other circuits responsible for other tasks. However, our recent studies on the stomatogastric nervous system (STNS) of crustacea have begun to question this concept of the CPG as a discrete and identifiable entity within the central nervous system. Here we review evidence showing that under neuromodulatory instruction, individual neurons can participate in different oscillatory motor circuits and hence more than one rhythmic behaviour, and even more profoundly, preexisting networks can be dismantled to specify dynamically a new circuit for an entirely different behaviour. This de novo network construction is achieved again by neuromodulatory-induced alterations in the oscillatory and synaptic properties of individual target neurons. On this basis, therefore, a functional CPG network must be seen in a more dynamic context than previously thought since it may exist only in a particular behavioural situation dictated by modulatory influences.},

  Abstract                 = {The stomatogastric nervous system (STNS) controls the movements of the foregut and the oesophagus of decapod crustaceans and is a good example for demonstrating that peptides are ubiquitously distributed chemical mediators in the nervous system. The stomatogastric ganglion (STG), one of the four ganglia of the STNS, contains the most intensively investigated neuronal circuits. The other ganglia, including the two commissural ganglia (CoGs) and the oesophageal ganglion (OG), are thought to be modulatory control centres. Peptides reach the STNS either as neurohormones or are released as transmitters. Peptide neurohormones can be released either from neurohaemal organs or from local neurohaemal release zones located on the surface of nerves and connectives. There were thought to be no peptidergic neurones with cell bodies in the STG itself. However, some have recently been described in adults of four species, in addition to a transient expression of peptides during development in two species. None of these peptidergic neurones has been investigated physiologically, in contrast to peptidergic neurones that project to the STG and have cell bodies in either the CoGs or the OG. It has been shown that neurones containing the same peptide elicit different motor patterns, that the peptide transmitter and the classical transmitter are not necessarily co-released and that the effect of a peptidergic neurone depends on its firing frequency and on which other modulatory neurones are co-active. The activity of modulatory projection neurones can be elicited by sensory neurones, and their activity can depend on the firing frequency of the sensory neurone. In addition to being found within the neuropile of ganglia, peptides are present in neuropile patches located within the nerves of the STNS, suggesting that these nerves can integrate as well as transfer information. Furthermore, sensory neurones and muscles exhibit peptide-like immunoreactivity and are modulated by peptides. Bath-applied peptides elicit peptide-specific motor patterns within the STG by targeting subsets of neurones. This divergence is contrasted by a convergence at the level of currents: five different peptides modulate a single current. Peptides not only induce motor patterns but can also switch the alliance of neurones from one network to another or are able to fuse different networks. In general, peptides are the most abundant group of modulators within the STNS; they are ubiquitously present, indicating that they play multiple roles in the plasticity of neural networks.},

All of the peptides had similar actions on the activity of neurons involved in rhythmic movements of the pyloric region of the stomach, decreasing the frequency of the pyloric rhythm in a dose-dependent manner. Diploptera allatostatin 3 (D-AST-3) was slightly more effective than the others. The absolute change in the frequency of the pyloric rhythm depended on the starting frequency, demonstrating that the effect of D-AST-3 depends on the preceding physiological state of the preparation. The largest decreases were observed when the starting frequency was slower than 0.8 Hz. Whole-mount immunocytochemistry with anti-Diploptera allatostatin 1 antibodies demonstrated the presence of allatostatin-like peptides in the paired commissural ganglia, the unpaired oesophageal ganglion and the stomatogastric ganglion, and in their connecting and motor nerves.

Using this system, we were able to explore cortical dynamics, with high spatial and temporal resolution, over period of <=1 yr from the same patch of cortex. The visual cortices of trained macaques were stained one to three times a week, and immediately after each staining session, the monkey started to perform the behavioral task, while the primary and secondary visual areas (V1 and V2) were imaged with a fast optical imaging system. Long-term repeated VSD imaging (VSDI) from the same cortical area did not disrupt the normal cortical architecture as confirmed repeatedly by optical imaging based on intrinsic signals. The spatial patterns of functional maps obtained by VSDI were essentially identical to those obtained from the same patch of cortex by imaging based on intrinsic signals. On comparing the relative amplitudes of the evoked signals and differential map obtained using these two different imaging methodologies, we found that VSDI emphasizes subthreshold activity more than imaging based on intrinsic signals, that emphasized more spiking activity. The latency of the VSD-evoked response in V1 ranged from 46 to 68 ms in the different monkeys. The amplitude of the V2 response was only 20-60\% of that in V1. As expected from the anatomy, the retinotopic responses to local visual stimuli spread laterally across the cortical surface at a spreading velocity of 0.15-0.19 m/s over a larger area than that expected by the classical magnification factor, reaching its maximal anisotropic spatial extent within \~{}40 ms. We correlated the observed dynamics of cortical activation patterns with the monkey{\textquoteright}s saccadic eye movements and found that due to the slow offset of the cortical response relative to its onset, there was a short period of simultaneous activation of two distinct patches of cortex following a saccade to the visual stimulus. We also found that a saccade to a small stimulus was followed by direct transient activation of a cortical region in areas of V1 and V2, located retinotopically within the saccadic trajectory.

  Abstract                 = {Electrical coupling between neurons with similar properties is often studied. Nonetheless, the role of electrical coupling between neurons with widely different intrinsic properties also occurs, but is less well understood. Inspired by the pacemaker group of the crustacean pyloric network, we developed a multicompartment, conductance-based model of a small network of intrinsically distinct, electrically coupled neurons. In the pyloric network, a small intrinsically bursting neuron, through gap junctions, drives 2 larger, tonically spiking neurons to reliably burst in-phase with it. Each model neuron has 2 compartments, one responsible for spike generation and the other for producing a slow, large-amplitude oscillation. We illustrate how these compartments interact and determine the dynamics of the model neurons. Our model captures the dynamic oscillation range measured from the isolated and coupled biological neurons. At the network level, we explore the range of coupling strengths for which synchronous bursting oscillations are possible. The spatial segregation of ionic currents significantly enhances the ability of the 2 neurons to burst synchronously, and the oscillation range of the model pacemaker network depends not only on the strength of the electrical synapse but also on the identity of the neuron receiving inputs. We also compare the activity of the electrically coupled, distinct neurons with that of a network of coupled identical bursting neurons. For small to moderate coupling strengths, the network of identical elements, when receiving asymmetrical inputs, can have a smaller dynamic range of oscillation than that of its constituent neurons in isolation.},

The distribution of time intervals between successive neuronal firings (interresponse time histogram), the firing rate as a function of input frequency, the variability in the time course of depolarization from trial to trial, and the strength-duration curve are derived for this model. The predictions are compared with data from the literature and good qualitative agreement is found. All parameters are experimentally measurable and a direct test of the theory is possible with present techniques. The assumptions of the model are relaxed and the effects of such experimentally found phenomena as relative refractory and supernormal periods, adaptation, potentiation, and rhythmic slow potentials are discussed.

  Abstract                 = {Neuromodulation by peptides and amines is a primary source of plasticity in the nervous system as it adapts the animal to an ever-changing environment. The crustacean stomatogastric nervous system is one of the premier systems to study neuromodulation and its effects on motor pattern generation at the cellular level. It contains the extensively modulated central pattern generators that drive the gastric mill (chewing) and pyloric (food filtering) rhythms. Neuromodulators affect all stages of neuronal processing in this system, from membrane currents and synaptic transmission in network neurons to the properties of the effector muscles. The ease with which distinct neurons are identified and their activity is recorded in this system has provided considerable insight into the mechanisms by which neuromodulators affect their target cells and modulatory neuron function. Recent evidence suggests that neuromodulators are involved in homeostatic processes and that the modulatory system itself is under modulatory control, a fascinating topic whose surface has been barely scratched. Future challenges include exploring the behavioral conditions under which these systems are activated and how their effects are regulated.},

  Abstract                 = {Optical imaging being one of the cutting-edge methods for the investigation of neural activity, it is very important to understand the mechanisms of how dye molecules work and the range of side effects that they may induce. In particular, it is very important to reveal potential toxic effects and effects impairing the functioning of the investigated neural system. Here, we investigate the effects of illumination in the presence of the commonly used di-4-ANEPPS voltage-sensitive dye on the rhythmic motor pattern generated by the pyloric central pattern generator in the crab stomatogastric nervous system, a model system for motor pattern generation. We report that the dye allows long recording sessions with little bleaching and no obvious damage to the pyloric rhythm. Yet, exciting illumination induced a temporary and reversible change in the phase relationship of the pyloric motor neurons and a concomitant speed-up of the rhythm. The effect was specific to the excitation wavelength of di-4-ANEPPS and only obtained when the neuropile and cell bodies were illuminated. Thus, di-4-ANEPPS acts as a photo-switch that causes a quick and reversible change in the phase relationship of the motor neurons, but no permanent impairment of neuronal function. It may thus also be used as a means to study the maintenance of phase relationships in rhythmic motor patterns.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding central pattern generator (CPG) circuits requires a detailed knowledge of the intrinsic cellular properties of the constituent neurons. These properties are poorly understood in most CPGs because of the complexity resulting from interactions with other neurons of the circuit. This is also the case in the feeding network of the snail, Lymnaea, one of the best-characterized CPG networks. We addressed this problem by isolating the interneurons comprising the feeding CPG in cell culture, which enabled us to study their basic intrinsic electrical and pharmacological cellular properties without interference from other network components. These results were then related to the activity patterns of the neurons in the intact feeding network. The most striking finding was the intrinsic generation of plateau potentials by medial N1 (N1M) interneurons. This property is probably critical for rhythm generation in the whole feeding circuit because the N1M interneurons are known to play a pivotal role in the initiation of feeding cycles in response to food. Plateau potential generation in another cell type, the ventral N2 (N2v), appeared to be conditional on the presence of acetylcholine. Examination of the other isolated feeding CPG interneurons [lateral N1 (N1L), dorsal N2 (N2d), phasic N3 (N3p)] and the modulatory slow oscillator (SO) revealed no significant intrinsic properties in relation to pattern generation. Instead, their firing patterns in the circuit appear to be determined largely by cholinergic and glutamatergic synaptic inputs from other CPG interneurons, which were mimicked in culture by application of these transmitters. This is an example of a CPG system where the initiation of each cycle appears to be determined by the intrinsic properties of a key interneuron, N1M, but most other features of the rhythm are probably determined by network interactions.},

  Abstract                 = {Most neurons in the mammalian \{CNS\} encode and transmit information via action potentials. Knowledge of where these electrical events are initiated and how they propagate within neurons is therefore fundamental to an understanding of neuronal function. While work from the 1950s suggested that action potentials are initiated in the axon, many subsequent investigations have suggested that action potentials can also be initiated in the dendrites. Recently, experiments using simultaneous patch-pipette recordings from different locations on the same neuron have been used to address this issue directly. These studies show that the site of action potential initiation is in the axon, even when synaptic activation is powerful enough to elicit dendritic electrogenesis. Furthermore, these and other studies also show that following initiation, action potentials actively backpropagate into the dendrites of many neuronal types, providing a retrograde signal of neuronal output to the dendritic tree. },

  Abstract                 = {Evoked dopamine release was monitoredin vivo from the olfactory tubercle of anaesthetized rats by differential pulse amperometry combined with carbon fibre electrodes which, in most cases, were electrochemically treated. Dopamine release was evoked by electrical stimulation of the ascending dopaminergic pathway. The dopamine release evoked by burst stimulation (20 s with a mean frequency of 6 Hz) was dose-dependently decreased byd,l-apomorphine (25–800 μg/kg, s.c.) or by quinpirole (50 μg/kg, s.c.) while the opposite effect was observed with haloperidol (12.5 μg/kg–0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) or withd,l-sulpiride (2–200 mg/kg, s.c.). Neither the D1 agonist SKF 38393 (10 mg/kg, s.c.) nor the D1 antagonist SCH 23390 (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) affected the evoked dopamine release. Moreover, sulpiride competitively antagonized the effects of apomorphine. The relative amplitude of the apomorphine inhibition was inversely correlated with the stimulation frequency (6 or 9 Hz). The increase induced either by haloperidol or by sulpiride was positively related to the stimulation frequency (from 3 to 9 Hz) and reached a stable value (+ 700% of the pre-drug-evoked dopamine release) with higher frequencies (from 9 to 20 Hz). This increase also depended on the duration of the stimulation: both single-train (10 pulses) or burst stimulations for 20 s, whose frequency inside the trains was in both cases 14 Hz, evoked a dopamine release which was minimally affected by sulpiride or haloperidol. In conclusion, in physiological conditions the amplitude of the impulse flow-dependent dopamine release is regulated by the extrasynaptic extracellular dopamine concentration which varies from 10 to 100 nM. This presynaptic autoinhibition is mediated by autoreceptors of the D2 type and is involved in the nonlinear relationship between impulse flow and dopamine release.},

  Abstract                 = {<p>In rhythmic motor systems, descending projection neuron inputs elicit distinct outputs from their target central pattern generator (CPG) circuits. Projection neuron activity is regulated by sensory inputs and inputs from other regions of the nervous system, relaying information about the current status of an organism. To gain insight into the organization of multiple inputs targeting a projection neuron, we used the identified neuron MCN1 in the stomatogastric nervous system of the crab, <italic>Cancer borealis</italic>. MCN1 originates in the commissural ganglion and projects to the stomatogastric ganglion (STG). MCN1 activity is differentially regulated by multiple inputs including neuroendocrine (POC) and proprioceptive (GPR) neurons, to elicit distinct outputs from CPG circuits in the STG. We asked whether these defined inputs are compact and spatially segregated or dispersed and overlapping relative to their target projection neuron. Immunocytochemical labeling, intracellular dye injection and three-dimensional (3D) confocal microscopy revealed overlap of MCN1 neurites and POC and GPR terminals. The POC neuron terminals form a defined neuroendocrine organ (anterior commissural organ: ACO) that utilizes peptidergic paracrine signaling to act on MCN1. The MCN1 arborization consistently coincided with the ACO structure, despite morphological variation between preparations. Contrary to a previous 2D study, our 3D analysis revealed that GPR axons did not terminate in a compact bundle, but arborized more extensively near MCN1, arguing against sparse connectivity of GPR onto MCN1. Consistent innervation patterns suggest that integration of the sensory GPR and peptidergic POC inputs occur through more distributed and more tightly constrained anatomical interactions with their common modulatory projection neuron target than anticipated.</p>},

  Abstract                 = {Previously (Syed et al. 1991) we described the 
ventilatory behavior of the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis 
and identified motor neurons that innervate various 
muscles involved in this behavior. In the present study 
we describe an interneuronal network that controls ven- 
tilatory behavior in Lymnaea. An identified interneuron, 
termed the input 3 interneuron (Ip.3.I), was found to 
be involved in the opening movement of the pneumo- 
stome (expiration), whereas another identified interneu- 
ron known as visceral dorsal 4 (V.D.4) caused its closure 
(inspiration). These cells have reciprocal inhibitory con- 
nections with each other, which accounts for their op- 
posing effects on common follower motor neurons. In 
isolated brain preparations a third identified interneu- 
ron, right pedal dorsal 1 (R.Pe.D. 1) initiated the respira- 
tory cycle by the excitation of Ip.3.I. Whereas Ip.3.I 
in turn excited R.Pe.D.1, the connections between 
R.Pe.D.1 and V.D.4 were mutually inhibitory. Both 
Ip.3.I and V.D.4 were active during spontaneously oc- 
curring respiratory behavior as recorded from semi-in- 
tact preparations, and selective hyperpolarization of 
V.D.4 during such spontaneous activity disrupted the 
respiratory behavior. Regarding peripheral feedback, the 
mechanical stimulation of the pneumostome during its 
opening movements not only caused closure but also 
inhibited Ip.3.I in the middle of its discharge. Ip.3.I and 
V.D.4 were also found to be multifunctional, inhibiting 
both locomotor and whole body withdrawal neural net- 
works. We conclude from these results that the rhythmic 
patterned activity underlying respiratory behavior in 
Lymnaea is generated centrally, and that the network 
described here therefore comprises a central pattern gen- 
erator.},

  Abstract                 = {1. The morphology and electrophysiology of a newly identified bilateral pair of interneurones in the central nervous system of the pulmonate pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis is described. 2. These interneurones, identified as left and right pedal dorsal 11 (L/RPeD11), are electrically coupled to each other as well as to a large number of foot and body wall motoneurones, forming a fast-acting neural network which coordinates the activities of foot and body wall muscles. 3. The left and right sides of the body wall of Lymnaea are innervated by left and right cerebral A cluster neurones. Although these motoneurones have only ipsilateral projections, they are indirectly electrically coupled to their contralateral homologues via their connections with L/RPeD11. Similarly, the activities of left and right pedal G cluster neurones, which are known to be involved in locomotion, are also coordinated by L/RPeD11. 4. Selective ablation of both neurones PeD11 results in the loss of coordination between the bilateral cerebral A clusters. 5. Interneurones L/RPeD11 are multifunctional. In addition to coordinating motoneuronal activity, they make chemical excitatory connections with heart motoneurones. They also synapse upon respiratory motoneurones, hyperpolarizing those involved in pneumostome opening (expiration) and depolarizing those involved in pneumostome closure (inspiration). 6. An identified respiratory interneurone involved in pneumostome closure (visceral dorsal 4) inhibits L/RPeD11 together with all their electrically coupled follower cells. 7. Both L/RPeD11 have strong excitatory effects on another pair of electrically coupled neurones, visceral dorsal 1 and right parietal dorsal 2, which have previously been shown to be sensitive to changes in the partial pressure of environmental oxygen (PO2). 8. Although L/RPeD11 participate in whole-body withdrawal responses, electrical stimulation applied directly to these neurones was not sufficient to induce this behaviour.},

  Abstract                 = {The pyloric network of the lobster stomatogastric ganglion is a prime example of an oscillatory neural circuit. In our previous study on the firing patterns of pyloric neurons we observed characteristic temporal structures termed ?interspike interval (ISI) signatures? which were found to depend on the synaptic connectivity of the network. Dopamine, a well-known modulator of the pyloric network, is known to affect inhibitory synapses so it might also tune the fine temporal structure of intraburst spikes, a phenomenon not previously investigated. In the recent work we study the DA modulation of ISI patterns of two identified pyloric neurons in normal conditions and after blocking their glutamatergic synaptic connections. Dopamine (10?50 µm) strongly regularizes the firing of the lateral pyloric (LP) and pyloric dilator (PD) neurons by increasing the reliability of recurrent spike patterns. The most dramatic effect is observed in the LP, where precisely replicated spike multiplets appear in a normally ?noisy? neuron. The DA-induced regularization of intraburst spike patterns requires functional glutamatergic inputs to the LP neuron and this effect cannot be mimicked by simple intracellular depolarization. Inhibitory synaptic inputs arriving before the bursts are important factors in shaping the intraburst spike dynamics of both the PD and the LP neurons. Our data reveal a novel aspect of chemical neuromodulation in oscillatory neural networks. This effect sets in at concentrations lower than those affecting the overall burst pattern of the network. The sensitivity of intraburst spike dynamics to preceding synaptic inputs also suggests a novel method of temporal coding in neural bursters.},

underlying respiration in a wide variety of model systems. The central pattern generator (CPG) controlling aerial
respiration in the pond-snail Lymnaea is a particularly well-studied model. Using in vitro and semi-intact prepara-
tions, the neural circuitry that controls aerial respiration has been characterized as consisting of three identiﬁed
interneurons. Furthermore, insight has been gained into the behavioural, cellular and synaptic mechanisms by which
this circuit controls respiratory rhythmogenesis. It has also been demonstrated that aerial respiratory behaviour can
be modiﬁed both by experience and by environmental factors. Studies have shown that, in a behavioural hierarchy,
respiration is subservient to the whole-body withdrawal response that respiratory behaviour can be modiﬁed through
operant conditioning, and that respiratory behaviour is altered by hypoxia. Through research on the Lymnaea
respiratory CPG we are coming to a better understanding of the construction and malleability of a CPG network. The
malleability of this CPG is of particular interest. No longer can neuronal networks underlying respiratory behaviour
be considered hard-wired; they have inherent plasticity.},

  Abstract                 = {Neuronal identity depends on the regulated expression of numerous molecular components, especially ionic channels, which determine the electrical signature of a neuron. Such regulation depends on at least two key factors, activity itself and neuromodulatory input. Neuronal electrical activity can modify the expression of ionic currents in homeostatic or nonhomeostatic fashion. Neuromodulators typically modify activity by regulating the properties or expression levels of subsets of ionic channels. In the stomatogastric system of crustaceans, both types of regulation have been demonstrated. Furthermore, the regulation of the coordinated expression of ionic currents and the channels that carry these currents has been recently reported in diverse neuronal systems, with neuromodulators not only controlling the absolute levels of ionic current expression but also, over long periods of time, appearing to modify their correlated expression. We hypothesize that neuromodulators may regulate the correlated expression of ion channels at multiple levels and in a cell-type-dependent fashion. We report that in two identified neuronal types, three ionic currents are linearly correlated in a pairwise manner, suggesting their coexpression or direct interactions, under normal neuromodulatory conditions. In each cell, some currents remain correlated after neuromodulatory input is removed, whereas the correlations between the other pairs are either lost or altered. Interestingly, in each cell, a different suite of currents change their correlation. At the transcript level we observe distinct alterations in correlations between channel mRNA amounts, including one of the cell types lacking a correlation under normal neuromodulatory conditions and then gaining the correlation when neuromodulators are removed. Synaptic activity does not appear to contribute, with one possible exception, to the correlated expression of either ionic currents or of the transcripts that code for the respective channels. We conclude that neuromodulators regulate the correlated expression of ion channels at both the transcript and the protein levels.},

  Abstract                 = {Neuromodulatory inputs play a critical role in governing the expression of rhythmic motor output by the pyloric network in the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion (STG). When these inputs are removed by cutting the primarily afferent stomatogastric nerve (stn) to the STG, pyloric neurons rapidly lose their ability to burst spontaneously, and the network falls silent. By using extracellular motor nerve recordings from long-term organotypic preparations of the stomatogastric nervous system of the lobster Jasus lalandii, we are investigating whether modulatory inputs exert long-term regulatory influences on the pyloric network operation in addition to relatively short-term neuromodulation. When decentralized (stn cut), quiescent STGs are maintained in organ culture, pyloric rhythmicity gradually returns within 3-5 d and is similar to, albeit slower than, the triphasic motor pattern expressed when the stn is intact. This recovery of network activity still occurred after photoinactivation of axotomized input terminals in the isolated STG after migration of Lucifer yellow. The recovery does not depend on action potential generation, because it also occurred in STGs maintained in TTX-containing saline after decentralization. Resumption of rhythmicity was also not activity-dependent, because recovery still occurred in STGs that were chronically depolarized with elevated K+ saline or were maintained continuously active with the muscarinic agonist oxotremorine after decentralization. We conclude that the prolonged absence of extraganglionic modulatory inputs to the pyloric network allows expression of an inherent rhythmogenic capability that is normally maintained in a strictly conditional state when these extrinsic influences are present.},

Neurons are vastly simpler than human beings are, but the metaphor is not completely silly because it illustrates the volatility of the notion of neural codes. Information theory has been developed precisely to quantify communication and is quintessential to an appraisal of neural codes. Applying information theory to neural activity (rather than to the synthetic communication systems for which it was developed) is however riddled with practical problems and subtleties, which must be clarified before reporting experimental results. The chapter considers other means of neuronal communication than the emission of action potentials or spikes and regards them as self-similar all-or-none events whose only distinctive features are the time of emission and the identity of the emitting neuron. The extent to which the firing rates of a population of neurons may or may not carry most of the information represented in the complete list of spike emission times is a question to be addressed experimentally in any given situation. },

together with the SO that was used to activate the system. The intrinsic properties of individual neurons were represented using two-
compartment models containing currents of the Hodgkin–Huxley type. Manipulations of neuronal activity in the N3t and SO neurons
in the model produced similar quantitative effects to food and electrical stimulation in the biological network indicating that the model
is a useful tool for studying the dynamic properties of the feeding circuit. The model also predicted novel effects of electrical
stimulation of two CPG interneurons (N1M and N2v). When tested experimentally, similar effects were found in the biological system
providing further validation of our model.},

  Abstract                 = {We present an ionic conductance model of chattering neurons in the neocortex, which fire fast rhythmic bursts in the gamma frequency range (âˆ¼40 Hz) in response to stimulation [Gray C. M. and McCormick D. A. (1996) Science274, 109â€“113]. The bursting mechanism involves a â€œping-pongâ€� interplay between soma-to-dendrite back propagation of action potentials and an afterdepolarization generated by a persistent dendritic Na+ current and a somatic Na+ window current. The oscillation period is primarily determined by a slowly inactivating K+ channel and passive membrane properties. The model behavior is compared quantitatively with the experimental data. It is shown that the cholinergic muscarinic receptor activation can transform the model cell's firing pattern from tonic spiking to rapid bursting, as a possible pathway for acetylcholine to promote 40-Hz oscillations in the visual cortex. To explore possible functions of fast burst firing in the neocortex, a hypothetical neural pair is simulated, where a chattering cell is presynaptic to an inhibitory interneuron via stochastic synapses. For this purpose, we use a synapse model endowed with a low release probability, short-term facilitation and vesicle depletion. This synapse model reproduces the behavior of certain neocortical pyramid-to-interneuron synapses [Thomson A. M.et al. (1993) Neuroscience54, 347â€“360]. We showed that the burstiness of cell firing is required for the rhythmicity to be reliably transmitted to the postsynaptic cell via unreliable synapses, and that fast burst firing of chattering neurons can provide an exceptionally powerful drive for recruiting feedback inhibition in cortical circuits. From these results, we propose that the fast rhythmic burst firing of neocortical chattering neurons is generated by a calcium-independent ionic mechanism. Our simulation results on the neural pair highlight the importance of characterizing the short-term plasticity of the synaptic connections made by chattering cells, in order to understand their putative pacemaker role in synchronized gamma oscillations of the visual cortex. },

Both the pyloric and gastric mill systems were simulated using a physiologically based network model. In the pyloric simulation the known synaptic connectivity of the 3 principal cell types in the pyloric rhythm was found to be sufficient to produce the correct sequence of cyclic bursting activity over a substantial range of parameter values, even though we did not simulate the known endogenous oscillatory driver potential of one of the cell types. It is not yet known whether the synaptic inhibition in the real system is in the right range to cause cyclic bursting in the absence of the driver potential, but the synaptic connectivity does appear to reinforce the cyclic pattern. Simulations were also done with alternative connectivity schemes to determine which synapses appear essential to generate the correct bursting sequence (in the absence of endogenous bursting activity). Other, more complex, systems simulated were: (1) all 5 cell groups of the pyloric system, and (2) the cells responsible for movement of the lateral teeth in the gastric mill. In both cases good qualitative agreement was achieved between model and real systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: The stomatogastric ganglion of the crab Cancer borealis contains the neurons that generate several different behaviors, such as the fast pyloric rhythm and the slower gastric-mill rhythm. It has previously been shown that many stomatogastric ganglion neurons can switch between pyloric-Â  and gastric-timed activity. However, the question remained whether these neurons really are integral members of several central-pattern-generating networks, or just passive followers that only change their activity patterns in response to a switch determined by other neurons. Results To address this question, we perturbed the activity of the "pyloric" ventricular dilator neuron and the "gastric" lateral gastric neuron during ongoing pyloric and gastric rhythms. In the absence of ongoing gastric rhythms, these neurons can fire in pyloric time, and perturbing them can reset the pyloric rhythm. During robust gastric activity, the lateral gastric and ventricular dilator neurons can fire in gastric time, and perturbing them can reset the gastric rhythm. Conclusion When stomatogastric ganglion neurons change their firing patterns, they also function as part of the circuitry that generates the new rhythm with which they are firing, demonstrating that individual neurons can be used as part of multiple pattern-generating circuits.},

  Abstract                 = {The modulation of the pyloric rhythm of the stomatogastric ganglion of the crab, Cancer borealis, by crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP) is described. CCAP activated pyloric rhythms in most silent preparations, and altered the phase relationships of pyloric motor neuron firing in all preparations. In CCAP, the pyloric rhythms were characterized by long lateral pyloric (LP) neuron bursts of action potentials. The threshold for CCAP action was approximately 10(-10) M, with increasing effects at higher CCAP concentrations. The changes in motor pattern evoked by CCAP produced significant changes in LP-innervated muscle movement. These movements were additionally potentiated by CCAP applications to isolated nerve-muscle preparations. Thus, enhanced motor neuron firing and increase of the gain of the neuromuscular junctions are likely to operate coordinately in response to hormonally released CCAP. High CCAP concentrations sometimes resulted in modification of the normal 1:1 alternation between the pyloric dilator (PD) and LP neurons to patterns of 2:1, 3:1, or 4:1 alternation. CCAP seems to activate slow intrinsic oscillations in the LP neuron, as well as enhance faster oscillations in the pacemaker group of PD/anterior burster (AB) neurons. Simulations of fast and slow oscillators with reciprocal inhibitory coupling suggest mechanisms that could account for the mode switch from 1:1 alternation to multiple PD bursts alternating with one LP neuron burst.},

This chapter describes the major sources of biological noise in neurons (nerve cells) and how each can be characterized experimentally. It reviews some of the consequences of biological noise and presents a detailed case study on how noise interacts with oscillatory dynamics in a particular population of neurons in the mammalian brain (stellate neurons of the medial entorhinal cortex). The chapter argues that intrinsic noise from voltage-gated sodium ion (Na+) channels is sufficient to alter the electrical dynamics of stellate cells in a number of specific ways. Key effects of intrinsic noise from Na+ channels include (1) enhancement of excitability and sensitivity to small stimuli, (2) alteration of cellular bifurcation behavior and â€œsofteningâ€� of the neural threshold; (3) enhancement of robustness of electrical behaviors in the face of perturbations of model parameters, (4) reduction of neuronal reliability in response to broadband stimuli, and (5) enhanced reliability with inputs that have significant energy content within the theta (4â€“12 Hz) band. },

A small number (5.9\%) of these neurons exhibit more than one axon. These neurons have morphologies consistent with that described for dentate granule cells. One axon typically arises from the soma while additional axons take origin from either dendrites or the soma. Both axons may be mossy fibers or one axon may be a mossy fiber and the second assume a morphology and distribution similar to that described for interneurons. These latter neurons therefore exhibit a mixed phenotype by having a granule cell morphology and an interneuronal axon type. These data suggest that some granule cells give rise to multiple mossy fibers or express a mixed axonal phenotype during maturation.},

The 14 pyloric neurons fall into six cell types, and DA actions are cell type specific. The transient potassium current mediated by shal channels (I(A)) is a common target of DA modulation in most cell types. DA shifts the voltage dependence of I(A) in opposing directions in pyloric dilator (PD) versus lateral pyloric (LP) neurons. The mechanism(s) underpinning cell-type specific DA modulation of I(A) is unknown. DA receptors (DARs) can be classified as type 1 (D1R) or type 2 (D2R). D1Rs and D2Rs are known to increase and decrease intracellular cAMP concentrations, respectively. We hypothesized that the opposing DA effects on PD and LP I(A) were due to differences in DAR expression patterns. In the present study, we found that LP expressed somatodendritic D1Rs that were concentrated near synapses but did not express D2Rs. Consistently, DA modulation of LP I(A) was mediated by a Gs-adenylyl cyclase-cAMP-protein kinase A pathway. Additionally, we defined antagonists for lobster D1Rs (flupenthixol) and D2Rs (metoclopramide) in a heterologous expression system and showed that DA modulation of LP I(A) was blocked by flupenthixol but not by metoclopramide. We previously showed that PD neurons express D2Rs, but not D1Rs, thus supporting the idea that cell specific effects of DA on I(A) are due to differences in receptor expression.},

  Abstract                 = {Linear leak currents have been implicated in the regulation of neuronal excitability, generation of neuronal and network oscillations, and network state transitions. Yet, few studies have directly tested the dependence of network oscillations on leak currents or explored the role of leak currents on network activity. In the oscillatory pyloric network of decapod crustaceans neuromodulatory inputs are necessary for pacemaker activity. A large subset of neuromodulators is known to activate a single voltage-gated inward current I(MI), which has been shown to regulate the rhythmic activity of the network and its pacemaker neurons. Using the dynamic clamp technique, we show that the crucial component of I(MI) for the generation of oscillatory activity is only a close-to-linear portion of the current-voltage relationship. The nature of this conductance is such that the presence or the absence of neuromodulators effectively regulates the amount of leak current and the input resistance in the pacemaker neurons. When deprived of neuromodulatory inputs, pyloric oscillations are disrupted; yet, a linear reduction of the total conductance in a single neuron within the pacemaker group recovers not only the pacemaker activity in that neuron, but also leads to a recovery of oscillations in the entire pyloric network. The recovered activity produces proper frequency and phasing that is similar to that induced by neuromodulators. These results show that the passive properties of pacemaker neurons can significantly affect their capacity to generate and regulate the oscillatory activity of an entire network, and that this feature is exploited by neuromodulatory inputs.

  Abstract                 = {Ionic conductances in identified neurons are highly variable. This poses the crucial question of how such neurons can produce stable activity. Coexpression of ionic currents has been observed in an increasing number of neurons in different systems, suggesting that the coregulation of ionic channel expression, by thus linking their variability, may enable neurons to maintain relatively constant neuronal activity as suggested by a number of recent theoretical studies. We examine this hypothesis experimentally using the voltage- and dynamic-clamp techniques to first measure and then modify the ionic conductance levels of three currents in identified neurons of the crab pyloric network. We quantify activity by measuring 10 different attributes (oscillation period, spiking frequency, etc.), and find linear, positive and negative relationships between conductance pairs and triplets that can enable pyloric neurons to maintain activity attributes invariant. Consistent with experimental observations, some of the features most tightly regulated appear to be phase relationships of bursting activity. We conclude that covariation (and probably a tightly controlled coregulation) of ionic conductances can help neurons maintain certain attributes of neuronal activity invariant while at the same time allowing conductances to change over wide ranges in response to internal or environmental inputs and perturbations. Our results also show that neurons can tune neuronal activity globally via coordinate expression of ion currents.},

  Abstract                 = {Dopamine (DA) modi?es the motor pattern generated by the pyloric network in the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the spiny lobster, Panulirus interruptus, by directly acting on each of the circuit neurons. The 14 pyloric neurons fall into six cell types, and DA actions are cell type speci?c. The transient potassium current mediated by shal channels (IA ) is a common target of DA modulation in most cell types. DA shifts the voltage dependence of IA in opposing directions in pyloric dilator (PD) versus lateral pyloric (LP) neurons. The mechanism(s) underpinning cell-type speci?c DA modulation of IA is unknown. DA receptors (DARs) can be classi?ed as type 1 (D1R) or type 2 (D2R). D1Rs and D2Rs are known to increase and decrease intracellular cAMP concentrations, respectively. We hypothesized that the opposing DA effects on PD and LP IA were due to differences in DAR expression patterns. In the present study, we found that LP expressed somatodendritic D1Rs that were concentrated near synapses but did not express D2Rs. Consistently, DA modulation of LP IA was mediated by a Gs-adenylylcyclase-cAMP-protein kinase A pathway. Additionally, we de?ned antagonists for lobster D1Rs (?upenthixol) and D2Rs (metoclopramide) in a heterologous expression system and showed that DA modulation of LP IA was blocked by ?upenthixol but not by metoclopramide. We previously showed that PD neurons express D2Rs, but not D1Rs, thus supporting the idea that cell speci?c effects of DA on IA are due to differences in receptor expression.},

One goal was to find fluorescence changes related to the increases in membrane conductance that underlie propagation. A second goal was to find large changes in fluorescence that would allow optical monitoring of membrane potential in neurons and other cells. Attempts were made to measure fluorescence changes using over 300 different fluorescent molecules and positive results were obtained with more than half of these. No evidence was found that would relate, any of the fluorescence changes to the increases in membrane conductance that accompany depolarization; most, instead, were correlated with the changes in membrane potential. The fluorescence changes of several dyes were relatively large; the largest changes during an action potential were 10−3 of the resting intensity. They could be measured with a signal-to-noise ratio of better than 10∶1 in a single sweep.},

Fluctuation analysis is a way to obtain information on low-level processes by studying the activity at a higher level. The chapter focuses on the underlying mechanisms and the possible functional role of fluctuations in the nervous system. The chapter approaches the problem at different complexity levels: (1) the microscopic or molecular level, (2) the mesoscopic or cellular level, and (3) the macroscopic or systems (neural network and brain) level. It discusses the molecular background of stochastic processes in ion-channel activity and gives mathematical descriptions of channel kinetics. It also discusses the functional role of microscopic fluctuations/disorder at the higher, cellular, and systems levels. The chapter investigates the underlying mechanisms of (1) the interval variability by considering channel kinetics and synapse function and (2) amplitude variability by considering some recent studies of hippocampal neurons. Some large-scale simulations of cortical models and the complex dynamics displayed by such systems are reviewed the role of fluctuations for the classical mind-brain problem are discussed. },
