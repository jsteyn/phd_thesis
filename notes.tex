\subsection{STG Models}

\textbf {Mathematical Model of an Identified Stomatogastric Ganglion Neuron (Buchholtz 1992)}

LP neuron has at least 3 different voltage-dependent outward currents and at least three important voltage-dependent inward currents. LP receives numerous synaptic inputs. Target for proctolin. As per Hodgkin-Huxley model each ionic current represented as the product of an activation a and a maximum conductance g, a driving fore (V-E). In some cases there is an inactivation factor b as well.

Mathematical models of cells can provide a powerful tool with which to dissect and analyze the contributions of individual currents to the activity of the cell. Recent studies include a series of models of a thalamic neuron.

\textbf{Dependence of firing pattern on intrinsic ionic conductances: Sensitivie and insensitive combinations. Goldman2000}
A conductance-based model was built using standard Hodgkin Huxley equationsto describe each one of five voltage-dependent conductances ($I_{Na}$, $I_{Kd}$, $I_{Ca}$, $I_{KCa}$ and $I_{A}$)  and a leak current.
